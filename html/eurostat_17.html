<h2>Calculate a fixity checksum for an object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses a hash function (md5) on an object and calculates a digest of the object
in the form of a character string.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fixity_checksum(data_object, algorithm = "md5")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_object</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataset downloaded with some eurostat package function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>algorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Algorithm to use when calculating a checksum for a dataset.
Default is 'md5', but can be any supported algorithm in digest function.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>“Fixity, in the preservation sense, means the assurance that a digital file
has remained unchanged, i.e. fixed.” (Bailey, 2014). In practice, fixity
can most easily be established by calculating a checksum for the data object
that changes if anything in the data object has changed. What we use as a
checksum here is by default calculated with md5 hash algorithm. It is
possible to use other algorithms supported by the imported digest function,
see function documentation.
</p>
<p>In the case of big objects with millions of rows of data calculating a
checksum can take a bit longer and require some amount of RAM to be
available. Selecting another algorithm might perform faster and/or more
efficiently. Whichever algorithm you are using, please make sure to report
it transparently in your work for transparency and ensuring replicability.
</p>
<p>This function takes the whole data object as an input, meaning that
everything counts when calculating the fixity checksum. If the dataset
column names are labeled, if the data itself is labeled, if stringsAsFactors
is TRUE, if flags are removed or kept, if data is somehow edited... all these
affect the calculated checksum. It is advisable to calculate the checksum
immediately after downloading the data, before adding any labels or doing
other mutating operations. If you are using other arguments than the default
ones when downloading data, it is also good to report the exact arguments
used.
</p>
<p>This implementation fulfills the level 1 requirement of National Digital
Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) preservation levels by creating "fixity info
if it wasn’t provided with the content". In the current version of the
package, fixity information has to be created manually and is at the
responsibility of the user.
