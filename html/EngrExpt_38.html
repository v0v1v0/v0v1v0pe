<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This study was an "inter-lab" study to investigate measurements taken
on a product at various facilities.  In particular, this company has a
research lab, a pilot line lab, and multiple labs at plants.  When
characterizing products and especially in trouble shooting performance
issues samples may be tested at multiple facilities and it is important
to know if there is an impact of location on the resulting measurements.
For this study material was sent to each lab and tested 7 times by two
testing methods, a 1-point method at all labs and a 5-point method at
two of the labs.
