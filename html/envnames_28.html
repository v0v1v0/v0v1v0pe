<h2>Return the value of the object at a given parent generation leading to the specified object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is mostly useful in debugging contexts to query the value of a variable in
specific environments of the calling stack.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_obj_value(obj, n = 0, silent = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>object whose value should be returned. The object can be passed either as a variable name or
as a string representing the object whose value is of interest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of parent generations to go back to retrieve the value of the object that leads to <code>obj</code>
in the function calling chain. See details for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>silent</code></td>
<td>
<p>when <code>FALSE</code>, the names of the environments and objects in those environments are printed,
as those environments are traversed by this function.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The result of this function is similar to using <code>eval()</code> or <code>evalq()</code> but not
quite the same. Refer to the Details and Examples sections for explantion and illustration
of the differences.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this function is to get the value of object <code>obj</code> in a given parent environment.
</p>
<p>Note that conceptually this is NOT the same as calling <code>evalq(obj, parent.frame(n))</code>,
because of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>evalq()</code> evaluates the object named <code>obj</code> in the environment that is at the
<code>n</code>-th parent generation. (Note the use of <code>evalq()</code> and not <code>eval()</code> because 
the latter evaluates the object at the calling environment first, before passing it
for evaluation to the given parent environment.)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>get_obj_value()</code> first looks for the object in the <code>n</code>-th parent generation
that <em>led</em> to the <code>obj</code> object in the calling environment (i.e. the environment
that calls <code>get_obj_value()</code> and only <em>then</em> evaluates it at the <code>n</code>-th parent generation.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The job performed by <code>get_obj_value()</code> is done as follows:
at each parent generation, there is a pair of "object name" &lt;-&gt; "object value".
The task of this function is to retrieve the object name at a given parent generation
and then its value based on the "path" (of variable names) that leads to the variable
in the function that calls <code>get_obj_value()</code>.
</p>
<p>In practice though the result of <code>get_obj_value()</code> is the same as the value
of the queried object at the calling function, since the value of the variables leading
to that object are all the same through the calling stack.
But using <code>get_obj_value()</code> can provide additional information if we set parameter
<code>silent=FALSE</code>: in such case the function shows the name of the different
variables that lead to the queried object in the calling function. An example is given
in the Examples section.
</p>
<p>The function can also be used to query the value of any object in a particular environment,
i.e. not necessarily the value of an object <em>leading</em> to an object existing in
the calling environment. This can be done somewhat with less writing than using <code>evalq()</code>.
</p>
<p>If the <code>obj</code> is given as a string, it also evaluates to the object value when an object
with that name exists in the given parent generation. However, the object should be passed
with no explicit reference to the environment where it is defined.
For instance we should use <code>with(env1, get_obj_value("z"))</code> and
<em>not</em> <code>get_obj_value("env1$z")</code>, which returns simply <code>"env1$z"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The value of the object in the <code>n</code>-th parent generation from the calling
environment, as described in the Details section.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>get_obj_name()</code> which returns the <em>name</em> of the object in the calling stack
leading to the queried object in the calling environment.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Example of using get_obj_value() from within a function
# The value returned by get_obj_value() is compared to the values returned by eval() and evalq()
compareResultsOfDiferentEvaluations &lt;- function(x) {
  cat("Looking at the path of variables leading to parameter 'x':\n")
  xval = get_obj_value(x, n=1, silent=FALSE)
  cat("Value of 'x' at parent generation 1 using get_obj_value():", xval, "\n")
  cat("Value of 'x' at parent generation 1 using eval():", eval(x, parent.frame(1)), "\n")
  cat("Value of 'x' at parent generation 1 using evalq():", evalq(x, parent.frame(1)), "\n")
}
g &lt;- function(y) {
  x = 2
  compareResultsOfDiferentEvaluations(y)
}
z = 3
g(z) 
   ## Note how the result of get_obj_value() is the same as eval() (=3)
   ## but not the same as evalq() (=2) because the queried object (x)
   ## exists in the queried parent generation (g()) with value 2.
   ## The results of eval() and get_obj_value() are the same but
   ## obtained in two different ways:
   ## - eval() returns the value of 'x' in the calling function (even though
   ## the evaluation environment is parent.frame(1), because eval() first
   ## evaluates the object in the calling environment)
   ## - get_obj_value() returns the value of 'y' in the parent generation
   ## of the calling function (which is the execution environment of g())
   ## since 'y' is the variable leading to variable 'x' in the calling function.
   ##
   ## NOTE however, that using get_obj_value() does NOT provide any new
   ## information to the result of eval(), since the variable values are
   ## transmitted UNTOUCHED through the different generations in the
   ## function calling chain.
   ## FURTHERMORE, the same value is returned by simply referencing 'x'
   ## so we don't need neither the use of get_obj_value() nor eval().
   ## The only interesting result would be provided by the evalq() call
   ## which looks for variable 'x' at the parent generation and evaluates it.

# Example of calling get_obj_value() from outside a function
x = 3
v = c(4, 2)
get_obj_value(x)         # 3
get_obj_value("x")       # 3
get_obj_value(3)         # 3
get_obj_value(v[1])      # 4
