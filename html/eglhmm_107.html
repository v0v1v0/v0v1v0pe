<h2>Sydney coliform bacteria data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transformed counts of faecal coliform bacteria in sea water
at seven locations: Longreef, Bondi East, Port Hacking “50”,
and Port Hacking “100” (controls) and Bondi Offshore, Malabar
Offshore and North Head Offshore (outfalls).  At each location
measurements were made at four depths: 0, 20, 40, and 60 meters.
</p>
<p>The data sets are named <code>SydColCount</code> and <code>SydColDisc</code>.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frames with 5432 observations on the following 6 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>y</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Transformed measures of the number of faecal
coliform count bacteria in a sea-water sample of some specified
volume.  The original measures were obtained by a repeated
dilution process.
</p>
<p>For <code>SydColCount</code> the transformation used was essentially
a square root transformation, resulting values greater than 150
being set to <code>NA</code>.  The results are putatively compatible
with a Poisson model for the emission probabilities.
</p>
<p>For <code>SydColDisc</code> the data were discretised
using the <code>cut()</code> function with breaks given
by <code>c(0,1,5,25,200,Inf)</code> and labels equal to
<code>c("lo","mlo","m","mhi","hi")</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that in the <code>SydColDisc</code> data there are 180 fewer
missing values (<code>NA</code>s) in the <code>y</code> column than in
the <code>SydColCount</code> data.  This is because in forming
the <code>SydColCount</code> data (transforming the original data
to a putative Poisson distribution) values that were greater
than 150 were set equal to <code>NA</code>, and there were 180 such
values.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>locn</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels “LngRf”
(Longreef), “BondiE” (Bondi East), “PH50”
(Port Hacking 50), “PH100”  (Port Hacking 100),
“BondiOff” (Bondi Offshore), “MlbrOff” (Malabar
Offshore) and “NthHdOff” (North Head Offshore)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>depth</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels “0” (0 metres),
“20” (20 metres), “40” (40 metres) and “60”
(60 metres).</p>

<p>A factor with levels <code>no</code> and <code>yes</code>,
indicating whether the Malabar sewage outfall had been commissioned.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>A factor with levels <code>no</code> and <code>yes</code>,
indicating whether the North Head sewage outfall had been commissioned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bo.com</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with levels <code>no</code> and <code>yes</code>,
indicating whether the Bondi Offshore sewage outfall had been commissioned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The observations corresponding to each location-depth combination
constitute a time series.  The sampling interval is ostensibly
1 week; distinct time series are ostensibly synchronous.
The measurements were made over a 194 week period.  See Turner
et al. (1998) for more detail.
