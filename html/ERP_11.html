Event-Related Potentials data from a study conducted by Shen et al. (2014) to investigate neural correlates of
impulsive behavior. </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In the study, adult males who scored at the top 25% and bottom 25% on a scale measuring trait impulsivity were recruited to participate in an ERP experiment.
There were twelve subjects in each impulsivity trait group (high or low).
Specifically, the influence of trait impulsivity in response inhibition was examined in a two-choice discrimination task using the stop-signal paradigm 
(Logan et al, 1984). Participants were asked to withhold their responses when a 'stop' signal appeared after the 'go' stimulus. ERP amplitudes 
from 32 scalp locations (channels) were recorded from 200 ms before signal onset till 1000 ms after with one reading per 2 ms.
Two of the 32 channels were excluded in the analysis by the authors. The response inhibition is a within-subject factor with two levels (successful or failed).

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("impulsivity")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 144 observations on the following 505 variables. The first four variables are categorical: <code>Channel</code> with levels <code>CPZ</code> <code>CZ</code> <code>FCZ</code> giving
the electrode position, <code>Subject</code> with levels <code>S1</code> <code>S2</code> ... to identify the subjects, <code>Group</code> with levels <code>High</code> <code>Low</code> for the membership to 
an impulsivity group and <code>Condition</code> with levels <code>Failure</code> <code>Success</code> for the response inhibition condition. The remaining 501 variables are the ERP values at
time 0 (onset), 2ms, 4ms, ..., 1000ms.
