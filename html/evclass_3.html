<h2>Decision rules for evidential classifiers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>decision</code> returns decisions from a loss matrix and mass functions computed
by an evidential classifier.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">decision(
  m,
  L = 1 - diag(ncol(m) - 1),
  rule = c("upper", "lower", "pignistic", "hurwicz"),
  rho = 0.5
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix of masses for n test cases. Each row is a mass function. The first M columns
correspond to the mass assigned to each of the M classes. The last column
corresponds to the mass assigned to the whole set of classes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>
<p>The loss matrix of dimension (M,na) or (M+1,na), where na is the number
of actions. L[k,j] is the loss incurred if action j is chosen and the true class
is <code class="reqn">\omega_k</code>. If L has M+1 rows, the last row corresponds to the unknown
class.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rule</code></td>
<td>
<p>Decision rule to be used. Must be one of these: 'upper' (upper
expectation), 'lower' (lower expectations), 'pignistic' (pignistic expectation),
'hurwicz' (weighted sum of the lower and upper expectations).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rho</code></td>
<td>
<p>Parameter between 0 and 1. Used only is rule='hurwicz'.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function implements the decision rules described in Denoeux (1997), with an
arbitrary loss function. The decision rules are the minimization of the lower,
upper or pignistic expectation, and Jaffray's decision rule based on minimizing a
convex combination of the lower and upper expectations. The function also handles
the case where there is an "unknown" class, in addition to the classes represented
in the training set.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A n-vector with the decisions (integers between 1 and na).
</p>
