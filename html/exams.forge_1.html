<h2>exams.forge: A brief description the package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>exams.forge</code> package was created with the main goal of "forging" exam
tasks in combination with the <code>exams</code> package, and it includes additional
functions to simplify the creation of Moodle exercises.
The package features various functions categorized into seven groups based on
their characteristics. These categories are named:
Data Conversion and Modification, Statistical Analysis,
Mathematical Computations, Exercise Generation, String Manipulation,
LaTeX and HTML Functions, and General Purpose Functions.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package is designed for educators who need to develop examination materials
in the field of statistics, particularly for introductory courses like Statistics I and II,
using the R programming language. The aim is to streamline the process of creating a
large number of assessment items, enabling instructors to focus on improving the quality
of the tasks themselves.
</p>
<p>We would like to acknowledge the support provided by the Multimedia Funding Program.
Their assistance has been invaluable to our project, and we extend our sincere gratitude
for their contributions.
</p>


<h3>Features of the package</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> Feature 1: <code>exams.forge</code> simplifies the generation of examination tasks by providing tools to
create a diverse array of statistical exercises, ensuring unique problem sets for each student.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Feature 2:  It includes functions for precise data conversion, statistical analysis,
and mathematical computations, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of generated exercises.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Feature 3: The package supports multi-format rendering, allowing the seamless creation of
LaTeX and HTML documents suitable for various educational platforms, such as Moodle.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Examples of functions included in the package:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ts_data</code>: Creates a univariate time series by combining elements of a
linear or exponential trend, additive or multiplicative seasonal adjustment, and white noise.
The resulting time series is structured as a <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ts_data object⁠</code>, allowing for further analysis and exploration.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lmatrix</code>: Creates a LaTeX or HTML representation of a matrix.
This function is useful for integrating well-formatted matrices into LaTeX or HTML documents.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>as_obs</code>: Creates a string representing observations with optional sorting
and LaTeX formatting, useful for generating readable data representations in educational materials.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Example usage of the package and its functions.
</p>
<p><code>
library(exams.forge)
# Generate a time series with specified parameters
ts_eg &lt;- ts_data(end = 20, trend = TRUE, trend.coeff = c(1, 0.5), season = TRUE, season.coeff = c(0.2, 0.1), error = TRUE, error.coeff = 0.1, digits = 2)
print(ts_eg)
</code>
</p>
<p><code>
# Create a matrix
mx_data &lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 2)
# Generate a LaTeX representation of the matrix with tooltip
eg_matrix &lt;- lmatrix(
 m = mx_data,
 title = "Example LaTeX Matrix",
 fmt = "
 byrow = TRUE,
 tooltip = "Die Tabelle hat 
cat(eg_matrix)
</code>
</p>
<p><code>
# Create a string representation of observations
observations &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
observation_string &lt;- as_obs(observations, last = " and ")
print(observation_string)
</code>
</p>
