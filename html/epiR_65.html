<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The methodology in this function follows the methodology described in Chapter 8 of Woodward (2014), pp. 295 - 329.
</p>
<p>A finite population correction factor is applied to the sample size estimates when a value for <code>N</code> is provided.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing the following: 
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.total</code></td>
<td>
<p>the total number of subjects required for the specified level of confidence and power, respecting the requirement for <code>r</code> times as many individuals in the exposed (treatment) group compared with the non-exposed (control) group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.exp1</code></td>
<td>
<p>the total number of subjects in the exposed (treatment) group for the specified level of confidence and power, respecting the requirement for <code>r</code> times as many individuals in the exposed (treatment) group compared with the non-exposed (control) group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.exp0</code></td>
<td>
<p>the total number of subjects in the non-exposed (control) group for the specified level of confidence and power, respecting the requirement for <code>r</code> times as many individuals in the exposed (treatment) group compared with the non-exposed (control) group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p>the power of the study given the number of study subjects, the expected effect size and level of confidence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pr</code></td>
<td>
<p>the prevalence of the outcome in the exposed group divided by the prevalence of the outcome in the unexposed group (the prevalence ratio).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>or</code></td>
<td>
<p>the odds of the outcome in the exposed group divided by the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group (the odds ratio).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The power of a study is its ability to demonstrate the presence of an association, given that an association actually exists.
</p>
<p>Values need to be entered for <code>pdexp0</code>, <code>pexp</code>, <code>n</code>, and <code>power</code> to return a value for the prevalence ratio <code>pr</code> and odds ratio <code>or</code>. In this situation, the lower value of <code>pr</code> represents the maximum detectable prevalence ratio that is less than 1; the upper value of <code>pr</code> represents the minimum detectable prevalence ratio greater than 1. A value for <code>pexp</code> doesn't need to be entered if you want to calculate sample size or study power. 
</p>
<p>When calculating study power or minimum detectable prevalence risk ratio when <code>finite.correction = TRUE</code> the function takes the values of <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> entered by the user and back-calculates a value of <code>n</code> assuming an infinite population. Values for <code>power</code>, <code>pr</code> and <code>or</code> are then returned, assuming the back-calculated value of <code>n</code> is equivalent to the value of <code>n</code> entered by the user.
</p>
<p>See the documentation for <code>epi.sscohortc</code> for an example using the <code>design</code> facility implemented in this function.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1:
## A cross-sectional study is to be carried out to quantify the association
## between farm management type (intensive, extensive) and evidence of  
## Q fever in dairy goat herds. The investigators would like to be 0.80 sure 
## of being able to detect when the risk ratio of Q fever is 2.0 for 
## intensively managed herds, using a 0.05 significance test. Previous evidence 
## suggests that the prevalence of Q fever in extensively managed dairy goat
## herds is 5 per 100 herds at risk and the prevalence of intensively managed
## herds in the population (the prevalence of exposure) is around 0.20.
 
## Assuming equal numbers of intensively managed and extensively managed 
## herds will be sampled, how many herds need to be enrolled into the study?
## You estimate that there are around 60 dairy goat herds in your study area.

pdexp1 = 2.0 * (5 / 100); pdexp0 = 5 / 100
epi.ssxsectn(N = 60, pdexp1 = pdexp1, pdexp0 = pdexp0, pexp = 0.20, n = NA, 
   power = 0.80, r = 1, design = 1, sided.test = 2, 
   nfractional = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)

## A total of 58 of the 60 herds need to be enrolled into the study 
## (29 intensively managed and 29 extensively managed herds).


## EXAMPLE 2:
## Say, for example, we're only able to enrol 45 herds into the study
## described above. What is the minimum and maximum detectable prevalence
## ratio and minimum and maximum detectable odds ratio?

epi.ssxsectn(N = 60, pdexp1 = NA, pdexp0 = pdexp0, pexp = 0.20, n = 45, 
   power = 0.80, r = 1, design = 1, sided.test = 2, 
   nfractional = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)

## The minimum detectable prevalence ratio &gt;1 is 3.64. The maximum detectable
## prevalence ratio &lt;1 is 0.

## The minimum detectable odds ratio &gt;1 is 4.65. The maximum detectable
## odds ratio &lt;1 is 0.
