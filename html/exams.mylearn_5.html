<h2>List of Special Characters that Users Have to Deal with Manually</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Some special characters are used both in writing and in
programming. Unfortunately, the HTML converter (the first
step of the XML file creation) sometimes mis-interprets these
unless special care is taken. In case of the characters listed
in this data frame, the user has to manually substitute the
code for the character in the Rmarkdown source.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If something does not work that is not listed here,
please try to find the the HTML code for your character and
open an issue on GitHub for the maintainer with an example.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>
