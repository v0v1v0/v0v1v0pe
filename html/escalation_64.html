<h2>Parse a string of phase I dose-finding outcomes to vector notation.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Parse a string of phase I dose-finding outcomes to a binary
vector notation necessary for model invocation.
</p>
<p>The outcome string describes the doses given, outcomes observed and groups
patients into cohorts. The format of the string is described in Brock (2019),
and that itself is the phase I analogue of the similar idea described in
Brock et al. (2017). See Examples.
</p>
<p>The letters T and N are used to represents patients that experienced
(T)oxicity and (N)o toxicity. These letters are concatenated after numerical
dose-levels to convey the outcomes of cohorts of patients.
For instance, <code>2NNT</code> represents a cohort of three patients that were
treated at dose-level 2, one of whom experienced toxicity, and two that did
not. The results of cohorts are separated by spaces. Thus, <code>2NNT 1NN</code>
extends our previous example, where the next cohort of two were treated at
dose-level 1 and neither experienced toxicity. See examples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">parse_phase1_outcomes(outcomes, as_list = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcomes</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string, conveying doses given and outcomes
observed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>as_list</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE (the default) to return a <code>list</code>;
FALSE to return a <code>data.frame</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>as_list == TRUE</code>, a list with elements <code>tox</code>,
<code>doses</code> and <code>num_patients</code>. If <code>as_list == FALSE</code>, a
data.frame with columns <code>tox</code> and <code>doses</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x = parse_phase1_outcomes('1NNN 2NTN 3TTT')
# Three cohorts of three patients. The first cohort was treated at dose 1 and
# none had toxicity. The second cohort was treated at dose 2 and one of the
# three had toxicity. Finally, cohort three was treated at dose 3 and all
# patients had toxicity.
x$num_patients  # 9
x$doses         # c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)
x$tox           # c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)
sum(x$tox)      # 4

# The same information can be parsed to a data-frame:
y = parse_phase1_outcomes('1NNN 2NTN 3TTT', as_list = FALSE)
y
