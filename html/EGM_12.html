<h2>WFDB path utilities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions are used to help find and locate commands from the
installation of WFDB. They are helpful in setting and getting path options
and specific WFDB commands. They are primarily internal helper functions, but
are documented for troubleshooting purposes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">find_wfdb_software()

set_wfdb_path(.path)

find_wfdb_command(.app, .path = getOption("wfdb_path"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>character</code> string that describes the path to the WFDB binary
directory</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.app</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of WFDB software command or application as a <code>character</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>These functions are helper functions to work with the user-installed
WFDB software. They do not always return an object, and are primarily used
for their side effects. They are primarily developer functions, but are
exposed to the user to help troubleshoot issues with their installation of
WFDB.
