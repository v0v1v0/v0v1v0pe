<h3>Details</h3>

<p>'n.for.survey' is used to compute the sample size required to conduct 
a survey. 
</p>
<p>When 'delta="auto"', delta will change according to the value of p. 
If 0.3 &lt;= p &lt;= 0.7, delta = 0.1. If 0.1 &lt;= p &lt; .3, or 0.7&lt; p &lt;=0.9, 
then delta=.05. Finally, if p &lt; 0.1, then delta = p/2. If 0.9 &lt; p, 
then delta = (1-p)/2.    
</p>
<p>When cluster sampling is employed, the design effect (deff) has to be taken 
into account.
</p>
<p>'n.for.2means' is used to compute the sample size needed for testing 
the hypothesis that the difference of two population means is zero.
</p>
<p>'n.for.cluster.2means' and 'n.for.cluster.2p' are for cluster 
(usually randomized) controlled trial.
</p>
<p>'n.for.2p'  is used to the compute the sample size needed for testing the 
hypothesis that the difference of two population proportions is zero.
</p>
<p>'n.for.equi.2p' is used for equivalent trial with equal probability of success 
or fail being p for both groups. 'sig.diff' is a difference in probability 
considered as being clinically significant. If both sides of limits of 95 
percent CI of the difference are within +sig.diff or -sig.diff, there would be 
neither evidence of inferiority nor of superiority of any arm. 
</p>
<p>'n.for.noninferior.2p' is similar to 'n.for.equi.2p' except if the lower limit 
of 95 percent CI of the difference is higher than the sig.inferior level, 
the hypothesis of inferiority would be rejected.
</p>
<p>For a case control study, p1 and p2 are the proportions of exposure among 
cases and controls.
</p>
<p>For a cohort study, p1 and p2 are proportions of positive outcome among the 
exposed and non-exposed groups.
</p>
<p>'ratio' in a case control study is controls:case. In cohort and cross-sectional 
studies, it is non-exposed:exposed.
</p>
<p>LQAS stands for Lot Quality Assurance Sampling. The sample size n is determined 
to test whether the lot of a product has a defective proportion exceeding 
a critical proportion, p0. Out of the sample tested, if the number of defective 
specimens is greater than q, the lot is considered not acceptable. This concept 
can be applied to quality assurance processes in health care. 
</p>
<p>When any parameter is a vector of length &gt; 5, a table of sample size by 
the varying values of parameters is displayed. 
</p>
