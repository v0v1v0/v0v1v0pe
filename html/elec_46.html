<h2>Santa Cruz Election Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>santa.cruz</code> and <code>santa.cruz.audit</code> hold data from a Santa Cruz
County, CA, contest held in November, 2008, for County Supervisor in the 1st
District.  The competitive candidates were John Leopold and Betty Danner.
According to the semi-official results provided to us by the Santa Cruz
County Clerk's office, Leopold won with votes on 45% of the 26,655 ballots.
Danner received the votes on 37% of the ballots.  The remaining ballots
were undervoted, overvoted, or had votes for minor candidates.
</p>
<p><code>santa.cruz.audit</code> holds the audit totals for the random sample of
precincts selected for the audit.  Note the <code>santa.cruz.audit</code> vote
counts are larger for some precincts due the missing provisional ballot
counts in the semi-official results.
