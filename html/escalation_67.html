<h2>Break a phase I outcome string into a list of cohort parts.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Break a phase I outcome string into a list of cohort parts.
</p>
<p>Break a phase I outcome string into a list of cohort parts.
</p>
<p>The outcome string describes the doses given, outcomes observed and the
timing of analyses that recommend a dose. The format of the string is
described in Brock (2019), and that itself is the phase I analogue of the
similar idea described in Brock _et al_. (2017).
</p>
<p>The letters T and N are used to represents patients that experienced
(T)oxicity and (N)o toxicity. These letters are concatenated after numerical
dose-levels to convey the outcomes of cohorts of patients.
For instance, <code>2NNT</code> represents a cohort of three patients that were
treated at dose-level 2, one of whom experienced toxicity, and two that did
not. The results of cohorts are separated by spaces and it is assumed that a
dose-finding decision takes place at the end of a cohort. Thus,
<code>2NNT 1NN</code> builds on our previous example, where the next cohort of two
were treated at dose-level 1 and neither of these patients experienced
toxicity. See examples.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">phase1_outcomes_to_cohorts(outcomes)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcomes</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string representing the doses given, outcomes
observed, and timing of analyses. See Description.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with a slot for each cohort. Each cohort slot is itself a
list, containing elements:
* <code>dose</code>, the integer dose delivered to the cohort;
* <code>outcomes</code>, a character string representing the <code>T</code> or <code>N</code>
outcomes for the patients in this cohort.
