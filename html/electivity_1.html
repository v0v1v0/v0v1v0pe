<h2>Algorithms for electivity indices and measures of resource use versus availability.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is essentially Lechowicz (1982) turned into an R package. It includes
all algorithms that were described therein plus the example data that
was provided for moth resource utilisation.

<p>Users are encouraged to read the original paper before deciding which algorithm
is most useful for them. Lechowicz recommended Vanderploeg and Scavia's E* index
(implemented in this package as <code>vs_electivity()</code>) as "the single best, but not
perfect, electivity index" because "E* embodies a measure of the feeder's
perception of a food's value as a function of both its abundance and the
abundance of other food types present." In practice, he found that all indices
returned nearly identical rank orders of preferred hosts except for Strauss'
linear index (L).
