<h2>Simulate clinical trials for several designs using common patients.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a list of several
<code>selector_factory</code>s, such as those returned by
<code>get_dfcrm</code>, <code>get_boin</code> or
<code>get_three_plus_three</code>, and conducts many notional clinical
trials. The simulated patients in the trials are common across designs. For
example, in a comparison of the three designs mentioned above, the first
simulated CRM trial uses the same notional patients as the first simulated
BOIN trial, etc. Using common patients within iterate across designs
reduces MCMC errors of comparisons, so this method is efficient for
comparing designs. See Sweeting et al. for full details.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>By default, dose decisions in simulated trials are made after each
cohort of 3 patients. This can be changed by providing a function by the
<code>sample_patient_arrivals</code> parameter that simulates the arrival of new
patients. The new patients will be added to the existing patients and the
model will be fit to the set of all patients. The function that simulates
patient arrivals should take as a single parameter a data-frame with one
row for each existing patient and columns including cohort, patient, dose,
tox, time (and possibly also eff and weight, if a phase I/II or
time-to-event method is used). The provision of data on the existing
patients allows the patient sampling function to be adaptive. The function
should return a data-frame with a row for each new patient and a column for
time_delta, the time between the arrival of this patient and the previous,
as in <code>cohorts_of_n</code>. See Examples.
</p>
<p>This method can simulate the culmination of trials that are partly
completed. We just have to specify the outcomes already observed via the
<code>previous_outcomes</code> parameter. Each simulated trial will commence from
those outcomes seen thus far. See Examples.
</p>
<p>We can specify the immediate next dose by specifying <code>next_dose</code>. If
omitted, the next dose is calculated by invoking the model on the outcomes
seen thus far.
</p>
<p>Designs must eventually choose to stop the trial. Some designs, like 3+3,
have intrinsic stopping rules. However, some selectors like those derived
from <code>get_dfcrm</code> offer no default stopping method. You may need
to append stopping behaviour to your selector via something like
<code>stop_at_n</code> or <code>stop_when_n_at_dose</code>, etc. To
safeguard against simulating runaway trials that never end, the function
will halt a simulated trial after 30 invocations of the dose-selection
decision. To breach this limit, specify <code>i_like_big_trials = TRUE</code> in
the function call. However, when you forego the safety net, the onus is on
you to write selectors that will eventually stop the trial! See Examples.
</p>
<p>The model is fit to the prevailing data at each dose selection point. By
default, only the final model fit for each simulated trial is retained.
This is done to conserve memory. With a high number of simulated trials,
storing many model fits per trial may cause the executing machine to run
out of memory. However, you can force this method to retain all model fits
by specifying <code>return_all_fits = TRUE</code>. See Examples.
