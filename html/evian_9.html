<h2>Example dataset with a quantative outcome.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset included the genotypic and phenotypic information of 781 individuals in proper formats. This dataset is used together with <code>evian_linear_bim</code> to illustrate how to use the main function <code>evian</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(evian_linear_raw)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is an example dataset for <code>evian</code> function. It contained 781 individuals, and for each of the individuals, their genotype at 10 SNPs and a continuous outcome (Y_norma) were stored. Three additional covariates (Fev, BMI_group, Age_group) were provided as well. Specifically, our function can incorporate with related individuals, some of these individuals in the dataset are correlated with others, and are specified through the <code>FID</code> column. This is usually what a plink .raw file looks like.
