</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Appropriate confidence intervals for the adjusted prevalence estimate are provided, accounting for the change in variance that arises from imperfect test sensitivity and specificity (see Reiczigel et al. 2010 for details). 
</p>
<p>The Clopper-Pearson method is known to be too conservative for two-sided intervals (Blaker 2000, Agresti and Coull 1998). Blaker's and Sterne's methods (Blaker 2000, Sterne 1954) provide smaller exact two-sided confidence interval estimates. 
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function uses apparent prevalence, test sensitivity and test specificity to estimate true prevalence (after Rogan and Gladen, 1978). Confidence intervals for the apparent and true prevalence estimates are based on code provided by Reiczigel et al. (2010).
</p>
<p>If apparent prevalence is less than (1 - diagnostic test specificity) the Rogan Gladen estimate of true prevalence will be less than zero (Speybroeck et al. 2012). If the apparent prevalence is greater than the diagnostic test sensitivity the Rogan Gladen estimate of true prevalence will be greater than one.
</p>
<p>When AP &lt; (1 - Sp) the function issues a warning to alert the user that the estimate of true prevalence is invalid. A similar warning is issued when AP &gt; Se. In both situations the estimated number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives is not returned by the function. Where AP &lt; (1 - Sp) or AP &gt; Se a Bayesian approach for estimation of true prevalence is recommended. See Messam et al. (2008) for a concise introduction to this topic.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1:
## A simple random sample of 150 cows from a herd of 2560 is taken.
## Each cow is given a screening test for brucellosis which has a 
## sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 89%. Of the 150 cows tested
## 45 were positive to the screening test. What is the estimated prevalence 
## of brucellosis in this herd (and its 95% confidence interval)?

epi.prev(pos = 45, tested = 150, se = 0.96, sp = 0.89, method = "blaker",
   units = 100, conf.level = 0.95)

## The estimated true prevalence of brucellosis in this herd is 22 (95% 14 
## to 32) cases per 100 cows at risk. Using this screening test we can expect
## anywhere between 34 and 56 positive test results. Of the positive tests
## between 23 and 42 are expected to be true positives and between 7 and 20 are
## expected to be false positives.


# EXAMPLE 2:
## Moujaber et al. (2008) analysed the seroepidemiology of Helicobacter pylori 
## infection in Australia. They reported seroprevalence rates together with 
## 95% confidence intervals by age group using the Clopper-Pearson exact 
## method (Clopper and Pearson, 1934). The ELISA test they applied had 96.4% 
## sensitivity and 92.7% specificity. A total of 151 subjects 1 -- 4 years
## of age were tested. Of this group 6 were positive. What is the estimated 
## true prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in this age group?

epi.prev(pos = 6, tested = 151, se = 0.964, sp = 0.927, method = "c-p",
   units = 100, conf.level = 0.95)

## The estimated true prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in 1 -- 4 year olds is
## -4 (95% CI -6 to 1) cases per 100. The function issues a warning to alert 
## the user that estimate of true prevalence invalid. True positive, false
## positive, true negative and false negative counts are not returned. 


## EXAMPLE 3:
## Three dairy herds are tested for tuberculosis. On each herd a different test
## regime is used (each with a different diagnostic test sensitivity and 
## specificity). The number of animals tested in each herd were 210, 189 and 
## 124, respectively. The number of test-positives in each herd were 8, 12 
## and 7. Test sensitivities were 0.60, 0.65 and 0.70 (respectively). Test 
## specificities were 0.90, 0.95 and 0.99. What is the estimated true 
## prevalence of tuberculosis in each of the three herds?

rval.prev03 &lt;- epi.prev(pos = c(80,100,50), tested = c(210,189,124), 
   se = c(0.60,0.65,0.70), sp = c(0.90,0.95,0.99), method = "blaker", 
   units = 100, conf.level = 0.95)
round(rval.prev03$tp, digits = 0)

## True prevalence estimates for each herd:
## Herd 1: 56 (95% CI 43 to 70) cases per 100 cows.
## Herd 2: 80 (95% CI 68 to 92) cases per 100 cows.
## Herd 3: 57 (95% CI 45 to 70) cases per 100 cows.
