<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Description of the <code>Votes_to_parties</code>, <code>Votes_to_candidates</code>, <code>District_cross_votes</code> and <code>District_cross_percentages</code> variables in more detail, where N(i), R(i) and C(i) denote, respectively, the number of voting units, party voting options and candidate voting options in district <code>i</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Votes_to_parties</code>: A list of 73 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing N(i) observations and 2+R(i) variables. The two first variables, <code>Polling</code> and <code>Address</code> inform, respectively, about the code in the district assigned to the voting unit and the voting unit address. The rest of the columns correspond to the votes gained by the different party voting options competing in the district. The orders of the voting units in <code>Votes_to_parties</code> and <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> coincide.

<li>
<p><code>District_cross_votes</code>: A list of 73 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing R(i) rows and 1+C(i) columns (variables). The first variable, which is labelled after the name of the district, contains the names of the parties in the same order than in corresponding <code>Votes_to_parties</code> tibble, the rest of the variables (columns), ordered as in the corresponding <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> tibble, are labelled as the candidate voting options.
