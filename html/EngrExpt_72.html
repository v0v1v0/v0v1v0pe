<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Comparison of eyeglass ultra-violet coatings
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 10 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>a</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector of differences in haze values for
the commercial coating</p>
</dd> 
<dt><code>b</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector of differences in haze values for
the commercial coating</p>
</dd> 
<dt><code>diff</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector of the differences in the two
above vectors</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A field test of a new coating was conducted with 10 volunteers who
wore glasses on a regular basis.  Each subject had one lens coated
with a commercial product and one lens coated with a test product.  The
coatings were applied to the lens in a random fashion such that some
subjects had the commercial coating on their right lens and some on
their left lens.  The haze of each lens was measured at the beginning
and the end of the study with the difference in haze being the measure
of interest.
