<h2>Effect of pollution on marine microinvertebrates in estuaries in different zones</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from an observational study of whether there is a different in microinvertebrate
communities between estuaries that have been heavily modified by human activity and those
that have not, across seven estuaries along the coast of New South Wales, Australia (Clark et al. 2015).
Sampling was undertaken in both Inner and Outer zones of the estuary.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(estuaryZone)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataframe containing (amongst other things):</p>

<dl>
<dt>Mod</dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor describing whether the sample was taken from a 'Modified' or 'Pristine' estuary.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Zone</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether the sample was taken from Inner (upstream) or Outer (downstream) zone of the estuary.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Estuary</dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with seven levels identifying which estuary the sample was taken from.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Total</dt>
<dd>
<p>Total abundance of all invertebrates in the sample</p>
</dd> 
<dt>Richness</dt>
<dd>
<p>Richness of taxa in the sample â€“ the number of responses (of those in columns 8-94) taking a non-zero value</p>
</dd> 
</dl>
<p>Other variables in the dataset give invertebrate counts separately for different taxa.
