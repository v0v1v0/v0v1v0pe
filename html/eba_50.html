<h2>Preference for School Subjects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two classes of children (ages 11 to 13) were asked to state their
preferences with respect to certain school subjects. Each child was given a
sheet on which were written the possible pairs of subjects and asked to
underline the one preferred in each case (Kendall and Babington Smith,
1940).
