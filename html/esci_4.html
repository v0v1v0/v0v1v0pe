<h2>Altruism Happiness - Ch12 - from Brethel-Haurwitz and Marsh (2014)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Happiness may not be important just for the person feeling it; happiness may
also promote kind, altruistic behavior. Brethel-Haurwitz and Marsh (2014)
examined this idea by collecting data on U.S. states. A Gallup poll in 2010
was used to measure each state's well-being index, a measure of mean
happiness for the state's residents on a scale from 0 to 100. Next, a kidney
donation database for 1999-2010 was used to figure out each state's rate
(number of donations per 1 million people) of non-directed kidney
donations-that's giving one kidney to a stranger, an extremely generous and
altruistic thing to do!
