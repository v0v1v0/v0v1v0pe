<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A meiosis matrix is a matrix where the number of rows is equal to the number
of genotypes and the number of columns to the number of haplotypes. It is a
matrix that allows to pass from parental genotypes to gametic haplotypes
by meiosis. It is a probability matrix in that the sum of the values in each
row is equal to 1. For a given genotype, the row associated with it
describes the probabilistic proportions that lead by meiosis to the
production of the other genotypes (and of itself if there are no mutations).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A meiosis matrix (probability matrix that associates to each
genotype in a row the probability of producing each of the possible
haplotypes).
