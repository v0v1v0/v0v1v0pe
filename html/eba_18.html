<h2>Weights Judging Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Beaver and Gokhale (1975) presented fifty subjects with all 20 ordered pairs
of bottles filled with lead shot and asked them to choose the bottle that
felt heavier.  The mass of the bottles was 90, 95, 100, 105, and 110 grams,
respectively.  Choice frequencies were aggregated across subjects for the
two within-pair presentation orders.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(heaviness)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 3d array consisting of two square matrices:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>heaviness[, , order = 1]</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>holds the choices where the row
stimulus was presented first for each pair (in the upper triangle, and
vice versa in the lower triangle).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>heaviness[, , order = 2]</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>holds the choices where the column
stimulus was presented first for each pair (in the upper triangle, and
vice versa in the lower triangle).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
