<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The EpiModel software package provides tools for building, solving, and
visualizing mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics. These tools
allow users to simulate epidemic models in multiple frameworks for both
pedagogical purposes ("base models") and novel research purposes
("extension models").
</p>


<h3>Model Classes and Infectious Disease Types</h3>

<p>EpiModel provides functionality for three classes of epidemic models:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Deterministic Compartmental Models:</strong> these continuous-time
models are solved using ordinary differential equations. EpiModel
allows for easy specification of sensitivity analyses to compare
multiple scenarios of the same model across different parameter
values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Stochastic Individual Contact Models:</strong> a novel class of
individual-based, microsimulation models that were developed to add
random variation in all components of the transmission system, from
infection to recovery to vital dynamics (arrivals and departures).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Stochastic Network Models:</strong> with the underlying statistical
framework of temporal exponential random graph models (ERGMs) recently
developed in the <strong>Statnet</strong> suite of software in R, network
models over epidemics simulate edge (e.g., partnership) formation and
dissolution stochastically according to a specified statistical model,
with disease spread across that network.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>EpiModel supports three infectious disease types to be run across all of the
three classes.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Susceptible-Infectious (SI):</strong> a two-state disease in which
there is life-long infection without recovery. HIV/AIDS is one
example, although for this case it is common to model infection
stages as separate compartments.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR):</strong> a three-stage
disease in which one has life-long recovery with immunity after
infection. Measles is one example, but modern models for the disease
also require consideration of vaccination patterns in the population.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS):</strong> a two-stage
disease in which one may transition back and forth from the
susceptible to infected states throughout life. Examples include
bacterial sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These basic disease types may be extended in any arbitrarily complex way to
simulate specific diseases for research questions.
</p>


<h3>Model Parameterization and Simulation</h3>

<p>EpiModel uses three model setup functions for each model class to input the
necessary parameters, initial conditions, and control settings:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>param.dcm</code>, <code>param.icm</code>, and
<code>param.net</code> are used to input epidemic parameters for each
of the three model classes. Parameters include the rate of contacts or
acts between actors, the probability of transmission per contact, and
recovery and demographic rates for models that include those
transitions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>init.dcm</code>, <code>init.icm</code>, and
<code>init.net</code> are used to input the initial conditions for
each class. The main conditions are limited to the numbers or, if
applicable, the specific agents in the population who are infected or
recovered at the simulation outset.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>control.dcm</code>, <code>control.icm</code>, and
<code>control.net</code> are used to specify the remaining control
settings for each simulation. The core controls for base model
types include the disease type, number of time steps, and number of
simulations. Controls are also used to input new model functions (for
DCMs) and new model modules (for ICMs and network models) to allow the
user to simulate fully original epidemic models in EpiModel. See the
documentation for the specific control functions help pages.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the models parameterized, the functions for simulating epidemic models
are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>dcm</code> for deterministic compartmental models.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>icm</code> for individual contact models.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Network models are simulated in a three-step process:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>netest</code> estimates the statistical model for the network
structure itself (i.e., how partnerships form and dissolve over time
given the parameterization of those processes). This function is a
wrapper around the <code>ergm</code> and <code>tergm</code> functions in the
<code>ergm</code> and <code>tergm</code> packages. The current statistical
framework for model simulation is called "egocentric inference":
target statistics summarizing these formation and dissolution
processes collected from an egocentric sample of the population.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>netdx</code> runs diagnostics on the dynamic model fit by
simulating the base network over time to ensure the model fits the
targets for formation and dissolution.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>netsim</code> simulates the stochastic network epidemic
models, with a given network model fit in <code>netest</code>. Here
the function requires this model fit object along with the
parameters, initial conditions, and control settings as defined
above.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We have also developed two extension packages for modeling specific disease
dynamics. For HIV and bacterial sexually transmitted infections, we have
developed <code>EpiModelHIV</code>, which is available on Github at
