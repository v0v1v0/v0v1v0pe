<h2>Lip cancer in Scotland 1975 - 1980</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set provides counts of lip cancer diagnoses made in Scottish districts from 1975 to 1980. In addition to district-level counts of disease events and estimates of the size of the population at risk, the data set contains (for each district) an estimate of the percentage of the population involved in outdoor industry (agriculture, fishing, and forestry). It is known that exposure to sunlight is a risk factor for cancer of the lip and high counts are to be expected in districts where there is a high proportion of the workforce involved in outdoor industry.
