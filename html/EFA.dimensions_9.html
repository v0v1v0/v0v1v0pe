<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>

<p>An all-numeric dataframe where the rows are cases &amp; the columns are the variables, 
or a correlation matrix with ones on the diagonal. The function internally determines 
whether the data are a correlation matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tests</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of the names of the tests for the number of factors that should
be conducted. The possibilities are CD, EMPKC, HULL, MAP, NEVALSGT1, 
RAWPAR, SALIENT, SESCREE, SMT. If tests is not specified, then 
tests = c('EMPKC', 'HULL', 'RAWPAR') is used as the default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>corkind</code></td>
<td>

<p>The kind of correlation matrix to be used if data is not a correlation matrix. 
The options are 'pearson', 'kendall', 'spearman', 'gamma', and 'polychoric'. Required only if 
the entered data is not a correlation matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Ncases</code></td>
<td>

<p>The number of cases. Required only if data is a correlation matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>HULL_method</code></td>
<td>

<p>From EFAtools: The estimation method to use. One of "PAF" (default), "ULS", or "ML", 
for principal axis factoring, unweighted least squares, and maximum likelihood</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>HULL_gof</code></td>
<td>

<p>From EFAtools: The goodness of fit index to use. Either "CAF" (default), "CFI", or "RMSEA", 
or any combination of them. If method = "PAF" is used, only the CAF can be used as 
goodness of fit index. For details on the CAF, see Lorenzo-Seva, Timmerman, and Kiers (2011).</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>HULL_cor_method</code></td>

<p>The results to be displayed in the console: 0 = nothing; 1 = only the # of 
factors for each test; 2 (default) = detailed output for each test</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a convenience function for tests for the number of factors.
</p>
<p>The HULL method option uses the HULL function (and its defaults) in the EFAtools package.
</p>
<p>From Auerswald &amp; Moshagen (2019):
</p>
<p>"The Hull method (Lorenzo-Seva et al., 2011) is an approach based on the Hull 
heuristic used in other areas of model selection (e.g., Ceulemans &amp; Kiers, 2006). 
Similar to nongraphical variants of Cattell's scree plot, the Hull method attempts 
to find an elbow as justification for the number of common factors. However, instead 
of using the eigenvalues relative to the number of factors, the Hull method relies 
on goodness-of-fit indices relative to the model degrees of freedom of the proposed 
model."
</p>
<p>The CD (comparison data) method option uses the CD function (and its defaults) in the 
EFAtools package. The CD method can only be conducted on raw data and not on 
correlation matrices.
</p>
<p>From Auerswald &amp; Moshagen (2019):
</p>
<p>"Ruscio and Roche (2012) suggested an approach that finds the number of factors 
by determining the solution that reproduces the pattern of eigenvalues best 
(comparison data, CD). CD takes previous factors into account by generating 
comparison data of a known factorial structure in an iterative procedure. 
Initially, CD compares whether the simulated comparison data with one underlying 
factor (j = 1) reproduce the pattern of empirical eigenvalues significantly 
worse compared with a two-factor solution (j + 1). If this is the case, CD 
increases j until further improvements are nonsignificant or a preset maximum 
of factors is reached."
</p>
<p>"No single extraction criterion performed best for every factor model. In 
unidimensional and orthogonal models, traditional PA, EKC, and Hull 
consistently displayed high hit rates even in small samples. Models with 
correlated factors were more challenging, where CD and SMT outperformed 
other methods, especially for shorter scales. Whereas the presence of 
cross-loadings generally increased accuracy, non-normality had virtually 
no effect on most criteria. We suggest researchers use a combination of 
SMT and either Hull, the EKC, or traditional PA, because the number of 
factors was almost always correctly retrieved if those methods converged. 
When the results of this combination rule are inconclusive, traditional 
PA, CD, and the EKC performed comparatively well. However, disagreement 
also suggests that factors will be harder to detect, increasing sample 
size requirements to N &gt;= 500."
</p>
<p>The recommended tests for the number of factors are: EMPKC, HULL, and RAWPAR.
The MAP test is also recommended for principal components analyses.
Other possible methods (e.g., NEVALSGT1, SALIENT, SESCREE) are less 
well-validated and are included for research purposes.
