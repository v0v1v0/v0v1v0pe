<h2>experDesign: Expert experiment design in batches</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Enables easy distribution of samples per batch avoiding batch and
confounding effects by randomization of the variables in each batch.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The most important function is <code>design()</code>, which distributes
samples in batches according to the information provided.
</p>
<p>To help in the bench there is the <code>inspect()</code> function that appends
the group to the data provided.
</p>
<p>If you have a grid or some spatial data, you might want to look at the
<code>spatial()</code> function to distribute the samples while keeping the original
design.
</p>
<p>In case an experiment was half processed and you need to extend it you can
use <code>follow_up()</code> or <code>follow_up2()</code>. It helps selecting which samples
already used should be used in the follow up.
