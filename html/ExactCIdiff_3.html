<h2>Inductive confidence intervals for the Difference Between Two Proportions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Three exact confidence intervals (two-sided, smallest lower one-sided and  smallest upper one-sided)  of level 1-alpha are constructed for p1-p2,
the difference of two dependent proportions. 
</p>
<p>A random vector (n11,n12,n21,n22) follows 
multinomial(N, p11,p12,p21,p22) where N=n11+n12+n21+n22, 
and p1-p2=(p11+p12)-(p11+p21)=p12-p21. Let t=n11+n22. 
Intervals [L(n12,t,n21),1], [-1,U(n12,t,n21)] and [L(n12,t,n21),U(n12,t,n21)] are of interest. 
</p>
<p>This package can be used to calculate these intervals using an inductive method
developed by Wang (2012).           
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An inductive construction is carried out to obtain one-sided interval. At each step we rank sample 
point by its potential confidence interval and then select the one with the
shortest interval. The difference of the two proportions is the parameter of interest.
There is a nuisance parameter in the tail probability 
(Eq (8) in Wang 2012). The nuisance parameter is 
eliminated by the maximization originally proposed by Buehler (1957).
A two-step grid search algorithm is applied to find the maximum. 
The first step is to roughly identify a neighbor area of the global 
maximization of the tail probability,  more points used more accurate results achieved. 
We recommend to use grid.one at least 30 to have accurate confidence intervals. 
The second step is to search for maximum within that smaller neighbor area, and  grid.two should be
at least 20. We find that this two-step grid search algorithm works much more accurate and efficient 
than the traditional one-step grid search algorithm. 1-alpha two-sided interval is equal to the 
intersection of two 1-alpha/2 one-sided intervals.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>PairedCI gives the estimate of (p1-p2), which is (n12/-n21)/(n12+t+n21), and the exact confidence interval.
