<h2>edbuildmapr: A package to download school district geospatial data, perform spatial
analysis, and create formatted exportable maps.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Import US Census Bureau, Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates
Program, Composite School District Boundaries Files for 2013-2019 with the
option to attach EdBuild's master dataset of school district finance, student
demographics, and community economic indicators for every school district in
the United States. The master dataset is built from the US Census, Annual
Survey of School System Finances (F33) and joins data from the National Center
for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data; the US Census, Small Area
Income and Poverty Estimates; and the US Census, Education Demographic and
Geographic Estimates. Additional functions in the package create a dataset of
all pairs of school district neighbors as either a dataframe or a shapefile
and create formatted maps of selected districts at the state or neighbor
level, symbolized by a selected variable in EdBuild's master dataset. For full
details about 'EdBuild' data processing please see: EdBuild (2020)
