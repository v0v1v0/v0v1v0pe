<h2>
Teaching Self Efficacy Scale
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data came from a published study and was kindly provided by Dr. Adnan Kan. A group of 307 pre-service teachers graduated from various departments in the college of education were asked to check on a 11 cm line segment with two end points (can not do at all, highly certain can do) using their own judgement for the 10 items that measure teacher self-efficacy on different activities. The direct item score was the distance in cm of the check mark from the left end point (Kan, 2009).
