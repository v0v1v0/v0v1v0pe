<h2>Cumulative network of positive affection within a monastery as a "network"
object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <code>network</code> object containing the cumulative "liking"
nominations of Sampson's (1969) monks over the three time points.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Sampson (1969) recorded the social interactions among a group of monks while
he was a resident as an experimenter at the cloister.  During his stay, a
political "crisis in the cloister" resulted in the expulsion of four
monksâ€“ namely, the three "outcasts," Brothers Elias, Simplicius, Basil, and
the leader of the "young Turks," Brother Gregory.  Not long after Brother
Gregory departed, all but one of the "young Turks" left voluntarily:
Brothers John Bosco, Albert, Boniface, Hugh, and Mark.  Then, all three of
the "waverers" also left: First, Brothers Amand and Victor, then later
Brother Romuald.  Eventually, Brother Peter and Brother Winfrid also left,
leaving only four of the original group.
</p>
<p>Of particular interest are the data on positive affect relations
("liking," using the terminology later adopted by White et al. (1976)), in
which each monk was asked if he had positive relations to each of the other
monks. Each monk ranked only his top three choices (or four, in the case of
ties) on "liking".  Here, we consider a directed edge from monk A to monk
B to exist if A nominated B among these top choices.
</p>
<p>The data were gathered at three times to capture changes in group sentiment
over time. They represent three time points in the period during which a new
cohort had entered the monastery near the end of the study but before the
major conflict began.  These three time points are labeled T2, T3, and T4 in
Tables D5 through D16 in the appendices of Sampson's 1969 dissertation.  The
<code>samplike</code> data set is the time-aggregated network.  Thus, a tie from
monk A to monk B exists if A nominated B as one of his three (or four, in
case of ties) best friends at any of the three time points.
</p>
<p>See also the data sets <code>samplk1</code>, <code>samplk2</code>, and
<code>samplk3</code>, containing the networks at each of the three
individual time points.
</p>
<p>The data set is stored as a <code>network</code> object with three
vertex attributes:
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
<p>Groups of novices as classified by Sampson:
"Loyal", "Outcasts", and "Turks".</p>
</dd> <dt>cloisterville</dt>
<dd>
<p>An indicator
of attendance in the minor seminary of "Cloisterville" before coming to
the monastery.</p>
</dd> <dt>vertex.names</dt>
<dd>
<p>The given names of the novices.  NB:
These names have been corrected as of <code>ergm</code> version 3.6.1; see details
below.</p>
</dd> </dl>
<p> In addition, the data set has an edge attribute,
<code>nominations</code>, giving the number of times (out of 3) that monk A
nominated monk B.
</p>
<p>This data set is standard in the social network analysis literature, having
been modeled by Holland and Leinhardt (1981), Reitz (1982), Holland, Laskey
and Leinhardt (1983), Fienberg, Meyer, and Wasserman (1981), and Hoff,
Raftery, and Handcock (2002), among others. This is only a small piece of
the data collected by Sampson.
</p>
<p>This data set was updated for version 2.5 (March 2012) to add the
<code>cloisterville</code> variable and refine the names. This information is from
de Nooy, Mrvar, and Batagelj (2005). The original vertex names were:
Romul_10, Bonaven_5, Ambrose_9, Berth_6, Peter_4, Louis_11, Victor_8,
Winf_12, John_1, Greg_2, Hugh_14, Boni_15, Mark_7, Albert_16, Amand_13,
Basil_3, Elias_17, Simp_18. The numbers indicate the ordering used in the
original dissertation of Sampson (1969).

<h3>Mislabeling in Versions Prior to 3.6.1</h3>

<p>In <code>ergm</code> version
3.6.0 and earlier, The adjacency matrices of the <code>samplike</code>,
<code>samplk1</code>, <code>samplk2</code>, and <code>samplk3</code>
networks reflected the original Sampson (1969) ordering of the names even
though the vertex labels used the name order of de Nooy, Mrvar, and Batagelj
(2005). That is, in <code>ergm</code> version 3.6.0 and earlier, the vertices were
mislabeled. The correct order is the same one given in Tables D5, D9, and
D13 of Sampson (1969): John Bosco, Gregory, Basil, Peter, Bonaventure,
Berthold, Mark, Victor, Ambrose, Romauld (Sampson uses both spellings
"Romauld" and "Ramauld" in the dissertation), Louis, Winfrid, Amand, Hugh,
Boniface, Albert, Elias, Simplicius. By contrast, the order given in
<code>ergm</code> version 3.6.0 and earlier is: Ramuald, Bonaventure, Ambrose,
Berthold, Peter, Louis, Victor, Winfrid, John Bosco, Gregory, Hugh,
Boniface, Mark, Albert, Amand, Basil, Elias, Simplicius.
