<h2>
ecocbo: Calculating Optimum Sampling Effort in Community Ecology
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A system for calculating the optimal sampling effort, based on the ideas of "Ecological cost-benefit optimization" as developed by A. Underwood (1997, ISBN 0 521 55696 1). Data is obtained from simulated ecological communities, and the optimization follows the following procedure of two functions (1)  scompvar() calculates the variation components necessary for (2) sim_cbo() to calculate the optimal combination of number of sites and samples depending on either an economical budget or on a desired statistical accuracy. Additionally, (3) sim_beta() estimates statistical power and type 2 error by using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance, and (4) plot_power() represents the results of the previous function.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions in <span class="pkg">ecocbo</span> package can be used to identify the optimal number of sites and samples that must be considered in a community ecology study by using simulated data. Together with <span class="pkg">SSP</span> package, <span class="pkg">ecocbo</span> proposes a novel approach to the determination of he appropriate sampling effort in community ecology studies.
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">ecocbo</span> is composed by five functions: <code>prep_data</code> gives the appropriate format to the data so that it can be used by the other functions in the package. <code>scompvar</code> calculates the components of variation for the analized dataset, and finally, <code>sim_cbo</code> determines an estimate of the number of sites and samples to consider to optimize the cost-benefit for an ecological sampling study. For getting more information on the data, <code>sim_beta</code> calculates statistical power for different sampling efforts and <code>plot_power</code> plots those results to help the user define the a combination of sampling effort and power to move on.
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">ecocbo</span> is being developed at Github(<a href="https://github.com/arturoSP/ecocbo">https://github.com/arturoSP/ecocbo</a>), where up-to-date versions can be found.
