<h2>weight functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function produces weight functions to reweight found audit miscounts.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">weight.function(
  name = c("no.weight", "weight", "weight.and.slop", "margin.weight", "taint")
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of function desired</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions are no weighting, weighted by size of precint, weight by size,
after a slop of 2 votes has been taken off, and weighing for pairwise margin
tests, and finally, the taint weight function that takes maximum error in
precincts and gives a ratio of actual error to maximum error.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A two-element list of two functions, the second being the inverse of
the first.  All the functions have three parameters, x, b\_m, and M, which
are the things to weight, the bound on votes (or maximum error in
precincts), and the (smallest) margin.
