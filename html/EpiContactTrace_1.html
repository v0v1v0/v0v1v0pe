<h2>Epidemiological tool for contact tracing.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Routines for epidemiological contact tracing and visualisation of
network of contacts.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In many countries, livestock movement data are collected with the
major objective to enable contact tracing during disease
outbreaks. Livestock movement data can also be of relevance for
risk based surveillance - both during outbreak or when
investigating if a disease is present in the population. However,
the livestock movement databases are not always structured in such
a way that relevant information for contact tracing or
surveillance design is easily retrieved. EpiContactTrace uses the
network parameters in-degree, out-degree, ingoing contact-chain
and outgoing contact-chain, which are relevant for forward- and
backward contact-tracing respectively. The measures can also be
used for identifying herds with many contacts, which can be used
in risk based disease surveillance. Different time periods for
ingoing and outgoing contacts can be of interest in the contact
tracing, based on possible window of introduction, and this can be
adjusted in the tool. The output from the analysis is available as
a dataset, but moreover, the tool automatically generates a report
on farm level. The report both contains an overview of the
situation on the farm, including a graph, as well as detailed
information including dates of movements on group or individual
level on all contacts.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## Load data
data(transfers)

## Perform contact tracing
contactTrace &lt;- Trace(movements = transfers,
