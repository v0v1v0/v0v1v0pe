<h2>Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering package.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Expectation-maximization binary clustering (EMbC) is a general purpose,
unsupervised, multi-variate, clustering algorithm, driven by two main
motivations: (i) it looks for a good compromise between statistical soundness
and ease and generality of use - by minimizing prior assumptions and favouring
the semantic interpretation of the final clustering - and, (ii) it allows
taking into account the uncertainty in the data. These features make it
specially suitable for the behavioural annotation of animal's movement
trajectories.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The method is a variant of the well sounded Expectation-Maximization
Clustering (EMC) algorithm, - i.e. under the assumption of an underlying
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) describing the distribution of the data-set - but
constrained to generate a binary partition of the input space. This is achieved by
means of the *delimiters*, a set of parameters that discretizes the input features
into high and low values and define the binary regions of the input space.
As a result, each final cluster includes a unique  combination of either
low or high values of the input variables. Splitting the input features
into low and high values is what favours the semantic interpretation of the final
clustering.
</p>
<p>The  initial assumptions implemented in the EMbC algorithm aim at minimizing biases
and sensitivity to initial conditions: (i) each data point is assigned a uniform
probability of belonging to each cluster, (ii) the  prior mixture distribution  is
uniform (each  cluster starts with the  same number of  data points), (iii) the
starting partition, (*i.e.* initial delimiters position),  is selected  based
on  a global maximum  variance criterion,  thus conveying  the minimum  information
possible.
</p>
<p>The number of output clusters is $2^m$ determined by the number of input features
$m$. This number is only an upper bound as some of the clusters can be merged along
the likelihood optimization process. The EMbC algorithm is intended to be used with
not more than 5 or 6 input features, yielding a maximum of 32 or 64 clusters. This
limitation in the number of clusters is consistent with the main motivation of the
algorithm of favouring the semantic interpretation of the results.
</p>
<p>The algorithm deals very intuitively with data reliability: the larger the
uncertainty associated with a data point, the  smaller the leverage of that data
point in the clustering.
</p>
<p>Compared to close related methods like EMC and Hidden Markov Models (HMM),
the EMbC is specially useful when: (i) we can expect bi-modality, to some extent,
in the conditional distribution of the input features or, at least, we can assume
that a binary partition of the input space can provide useful information, and
(ii) a first order temporal dependence assumption, a necessary condition in HMM,
can not be guaranteed.
</p>
<p>The EMbC R-package is mainly intended for the behavioural annotation of animals'
movement trajectories where an easy interpretation of the final clustering and the
reliability of the data constitute two key issues, and the conditions of bi-modality
and unfair temporal dependence usually hold. In particular, the temporal dependence
condition is easily violated in animal's movement trajectories because of the
heterogeneity in empirical time series due to large gaps, or prefixed sampling
scheduling.
</p>
<p>Input movement trajectories are given either as a *data.frame* or a *Move* object
from the **move** R-package.  The package deals also with stacks of trajectories for
population level analysis. Segmentation is based on local estimates of velocity and
turning angle, eventually including a solar position covariate as a daytime
indicator.
</p>
<p>The core clustering method is complemented with a set of functions to easily
visualize and analyze the output:
</p>
<p>* clustering statistics,
* clustering scatterplot (2D and 3D)
* temporal labeling profile (ethogram),
* plotting of intermediate variables,
* confusion matrix (numerical validation with respect to an expert's labeling),
* visual validation with external information (e.g. environmental data),
* generation of kml or webmap docs for detailed inspection of the output.
</p>
<p>Also, some functions are provided to further refine the output, either by
pre-processing (smoothing) the input data or by post-processing (smoothing,
relabeling, merging) the output labeling.
</p>
<p>The results obtained for different empirical datasets suggest that the EMbC
algorithm  behaves reasonably well for a wide range  of tracking technologies,
species, and ecological contexts (e.g. migration, foraging).
