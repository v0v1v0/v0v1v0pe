<h2>Conduct trinomial audit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>trinomial.audit</code> converts the audited total counts for candidates to
overstatements and taints. <code>trinomial.bound</code> calculates the trinomial
bound given the size of an audit sample, the number of non-zero errors, and
the size of the small-error threshold. It can also plot a contour of the
distribution space, bounds, and alpha lines.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">trinomial.audit(Z, audit)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Z</code></td>
<td>
<p>An elec.data object that is the race being audited.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>audit</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame with a column for each candidate and a row for
each audited precinct, holding the audit totals for each candidate. An
additional column, <code>count</code>, holds the number of times that precinct was
sampled (since sampling was done by replacement).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Right now the p-value is computed in a clumsy, bad way.  A grid of points
over (0, xlim) X (0, ylim) is generated corresponding to values of p0 and
pd, and for each point the mean of that distribution and the chance of
generating an outcome as extreme as k is calculated.  Then the set of points
with an outcome close to alpha is extrated, and the corresponding bound is
optimized over this subset.  Not the best way to do things.
