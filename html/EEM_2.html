<h2>Apple juice</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Apples of each of six types (Aomori–Fuji, Aomori–Jona, Aomori–Ohrin, NZ–Envy, NZ–Jazz, NZ–Fuji) 
were blended and filtered using a gauze. Fluorescence profiles of complete excitation–emission matrix 
of filtered solutions (diluted with water to 147 times) were measured using fluorescence spectroscopy machines. The sample name refers to "type–fruit number–replicate". To save space, only two apples of each types were given in the dataset.
