<h2>
Mixture Models with Component-Wise Factor Analyzers
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides functions for fitting
mixtures of factor analyzers (MFA) and
mixtures of common factor analyzers (MCFA) models.
</p>
<p>MFA and MCFA models belong to the class of finite mixture models,
that adopt factor models for the component-covariance matrices.
More specifically, under the factor model,
the correlations between feature variables can be explained by the
linear dependance of these variables on a smaller small number
<em>q</em> of (unobservable) latent factors.
The component distributions can be either from the family of
multivariate normals or from the family of multivariate
<em>t</em>-distributions.
Maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters
is implemented using the Expectation–Maximization algorithm.
</p>
<p>The joint distribution of the factors and errors can be taken
to be either the multivariate normal or <em>t</em>-distribution.
The factor analytic representation of the component-covariance
matrices is a way of dimension reduction in that it
enables the mixture distributions
to be fitted  to data with dimension <em>p</em>
relatively large compared to the sample size <em>n</em>.
</p>
<p>Unlike MFA, MCFA models can be used to display the
observed data points in the <em>q</em>-dimensional factor space.
The MCFA would also provide a greater reduction in the number of
parameters in the model.
