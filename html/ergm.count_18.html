<h2>Karate club social network of Zachary (1977)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Zachary (1977) reported observations of social relations in a university
karate club, with membership that varied between 50 and 100, of whom 34
individuals: 32 ordinary club members and officers, the club president
("John A."), and the part-time instructor ("Mr. Hi"); consistently
interacted outside of the club. Over the course of the study, the club
divided into two factions, and, ultimately, split into two clubs, one led by
Hi and the other by John and the original club's officers. The split was
driven by a disagreement over whether Hi could unilaterally change the level
of compensation for his services.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data are represented as a <code>network</code> object, with an
edge attribute <code>contexts</code>, giving the number of contexts of interaction
for that pair of actors. In addition, the following vertex attributes are
provided: </p>
 <dl>
<dt>list("club")</dt>
<dd>
<p>the club in which the actor ended
up;</p>
</dd>
<dt>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>the club in which the actor ended up;</p>
</dd>
<dt>list("faction")</dt>
<dd>
<p>faction alignment of the actor as recorded by
Zachary</p>
</dd>
<dt>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>faction alignment of the actor as recorded by Zachary</p>
</dd>
<dt>list("faction.id")</dt>
<dd>
<p>faction alignment coded numerically, as <code class="reqn">-2</code>
(strongly Mr. Hi's), <code class="reqn">-1</code> (weakly Mr. Hi's), <code class="reqn">0</code> (neutral), <code class="reqn">+1</code>
(weakly John's), and <code class="reqn">+2</code> (strongly John's);</p>
</dd> <dt>list("role")</dt>
<dd>
<p>role
of the actor in the network (Instructor, Member, or President)</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Zachary identifies the faction with which each of the 34 actors was aligned
and how strongly and reports, for each pair of actors, the count of social
contexts in which they interacted. The 8 contexts recorded were </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> academic classes at the university; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Hi's private karate studio
in his night classes; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Hi's private karate studio where he taught on
weekends; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> student-teaching at Hi's studio; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the university
rathskeller (bar) located near the karate club; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a bar located near the
university campus; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> open karate tournaments in the area; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intercollegiate karate tournaments. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The highest number of contexts of interaction for a pair of individuals that
was observed was 7.
