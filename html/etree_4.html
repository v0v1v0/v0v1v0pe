<h2>Classification toy dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simple dataset containing simulated values for a nominal response variable
and four covariates of both mixed and partially structured type. The data
generation process is based on Example 4.7 (”Signal shape classification”,
pages 73-77) from Saito (1994).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data_cls
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>List with two elements: <code>covs</code>, which is a list containing the
covariates, and <code>resp</code>, which is a factor of length 150 representing
the response variable. The response variable is divided into three classes
whose labels are cylinder (<code>Cyl</code>), bell (<code>Bel</code>) and funnel
(<code>Fun</code>). The four covariates in <code>covs</code> all have length 150 and
are characterized as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Nominal: <code>Cyl</code> observations are given level 1 with probability 0.8
and levels 2 and 3 with probability 0.1 each, <code>Bel</code> observations are
given level 2 with probability 0.8 and levels 1 and 3 with probability 0.1
each, <code>Fun</code> observations are given level 3 with probability 0.8 and
levels 1 and 2 with probability 0.1 each;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Numeric: coefficients for one of the basis used to perform the
B-splines expansion of the curves that are in turn specified as in Saito
(1994);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Functional: curves as specified in Saito (1994);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Graphs: Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs with connection probability 0.10 for
<code>Cyl</code> observations, 0.125 for <code>Bel</code> observations, 0.15 for
<code>Fun</code> observations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
