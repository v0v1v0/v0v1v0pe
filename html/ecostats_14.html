<h2>Headbob displays of <em>Anolis</em> lizards</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Displays of 14 male <em>Anolis</em> lizards were recorded in Puerto Rican forest (Ord <em>et al. 2016</em>),
along with key environmental characteristics. These lizards bob their head up
and down (and do push-ups) in attempts to attract the attention of females, and
advertise territory ownership to other males.
How fast a lizard bobs its head was recorded, and it was of interest to understand
which environmental features (out of temperature, light and noisiness) were 
related to head bobbing speed.

<dd>
<p>Temperature, in degrees Celsius, at the location where lizard was first observed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>AmbientLight</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ambient light recorded using a handheld sensor pointed towards the bobbing is happening.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bg_noise_max</dt>
<dd>
<p>Visual background noise measured using video analysis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hbspd_max</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum head-bobbing speed.</p>
</dd>
