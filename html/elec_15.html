<h2>Statistical Election Audits Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a collection of functions written to do various sorts of statistical
election audits.  There are also functions to generate simulated voting
data, and simulated “truth” so as to do simulations to check
charactaristics of these methods.  The package includes two data sets
consisting of actual reported voting results for races held November, 2008,
in California.  It also includes actual audit date for one of these races.

<p>There are three general audit styles implemented in this package.  For each
style there are two main computational tasks provided: estimate the needed
sample size and expected workload, and calculate $P$-values for a given
audit result.  The three methods are CAST (see
<code>CAST.calc.sample</code> and <code>CAST.audit</code>, the Trinomial Bound
(see <code>tri.calc.sample</code> and <code>trinomial.audit</code>), and the
Kaplan-Markov (KM) Bound (see <code>KM.calc.sample</code> and
<code>KM.audit</code>).
</p>
<p>The examples primarily use a data set included in the package,
<code>santa.cruz</code> and <code>santa.cruz.audit</code>, which holds the
ballot counts for a Santa Cruz, CA race that we audited using these methods.
See <code>trinomial.bound</code> for how these data were analyzed.  The
<code>yolo</code> data set holds precinct level counts for a race in Yolo
county.
</p>
<p>There are also many functions allowing for construction of new audit methods
and simulations.  This includes methods that generate fake race data that
can be used for computational simulations to assess the efficay of different
auditing approaches (see, e.g., <code>make.sample</code> and
<code>make.truth</code>).
</p>
<p>The package grew out of an earlier, disorganized package that implemented
general routines for election auditing.  Pieces of this package are used by
the aforementioned cleaner methods, but all the individual functions are
still there for specific uses, such as making different tests.  Start with
stark.test, which has an index of these pieces in its “see also”
section.
</p>
<p>If you find yourself confused, please contact the maintainer, L. Miratrix,
for help.  This will help improve the clarity of the package a great deal.
