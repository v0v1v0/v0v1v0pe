<pre><code class="language-R">  nops_fix(scans = dir(pattern = "^nops_scan_[[:digit:]]*\\.zip$"),
    exam = NULL, id = NULL, field = NULL, answer = NULL, check = NULL, display = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scans</code></td>
<td>
<p>character. File name of the ZIP file with scanning results
(containing Daten.txt and PNG files) as produced by
<code>nops_scan</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exam</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer. Rows number from the scanned data which should (potentially)
be fixed (default: all rows).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>id</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer or character. Either a vector with full 11-digit exam IDs
for the exams to be checked. Or the last five digits of the full 11-digit ID
(where leading zeros can be omitted).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>field</code></td>
<td>
<p>character indicating which field(s) from the scanned data should
be fixed. One or more of <code>"type"</code> (3-digit exam sheet type), <code>"id"</code>
(11-digit exam ID), <code>"registration"</code> (registration ID, can be between 7 and
10 digits), <code>"answers"</code> (individual answer checkboxes). By default all fields
with invalid entries have to be fixed.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>answer</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer indicating which answer checkboxes should (potentially) be
fixed if <code>field</code> contains <code>"answers"</code> (default: all answers).</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>check</code></td>
<td>
<p>character indicating additional check conditions for the answers:

<p>character indicating how the scanned image should be displayed.
One or both of <code>"plot"</code> (display scanned excerpt in R plot) and

otherwise.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>nops_fix</code> is a companion function for <code>exams2nops</code>
and <code>nops_scan</code>. To fix problems that potentially occurred
when extracting the exam information from the scanned PDF/PNG images,
<code>nops_fix</code> can iterate through the scanned data and interactively prompt
for fields that (potentially) need to be fixed. Typical cases are when errors
occurred in entering the registration ID or when the entire exam sheet could
not be read correctly. See below for a couple of typical application examples.
</p>
<p>For each specified field the user is prompted for a potential update. By just
pressing ENTER the current value of the field is preserved. If an update is not
a valid specification of the field, the prompt is repeated (along with some additional
instructions) until a valid specification is entered by the user.
</p>
<p>The type of sheed needs to be a 3-digit number, the exam ID needs to be an 11-digit
number, and the registration ID needs to be a number with 7-10 digits.
</p>
<p>All answer fields eventually store the multiple-choice answers with 0/1 indicators
of length 5. The following input formats are accepted:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 0/1 indicators of length up to 5. If less then 5 digits are specified, the remaining digits are filled with 0s.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Letters from a to e indicating the box(es) that have been checked.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Integers from 1 to 5 indicating which single box has been checked.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> No checked box can be indicated by <code>"0"</code>, <code>"-"</code>, or <code>" "</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame with one line per scanned file is returned invisibly. The output contains the
following columns: file name, sheet ID (11 digits), scrambling (2 digits),
type of sheet (3 digits, coding the number of questions rounded up to steps of 5
and the length of the registration number),
0/1 indicator whether the replacement sheet was used,
registration number (7-10 digits),
45 multiple choice answers of length 5 (all 00000 if unused).
