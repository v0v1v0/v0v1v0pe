<p>Appearance ratings of washed and unwashed panels
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 36 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>type</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>type of treatment - a factor with levels
<code>NW</code> (not washed) and <code>W</code> (washed)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>initial rating</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>rating after 2 weeks</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A particular durability test of paint involves applying drops of acid
on the panel. After a particular time point the panel is rated for its
ability to withstand the acid.  This study involved washing (or not
washing) panels and then storing them for two weeks to see if there
was a residual effect of the acid on the panel.  This was important as
panels are often stored and used in presentations so the researchers
needed to know if they should wash the panels before storing them.
