<h2>Part of the food web from upland streams in south Wales, UK</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Part of a food web from upland streams in south Wales, UK, comprising 85
individuals of two macroinvertebrate predator species (the caddisfly
<em>Rhyacophila dorsalis</em> and the stonefly <em> Dinocras cephalotes</em>).
Data were collected in Dec 2013 from six streams spread across an
agricultural intensity gradient as part of a wider study (Pearson
<em>et al</em>. 2018). The data comprise presence or absence of predation
by each predator on 16 potential prey taxa determined using next
generation sequencing of predator gut contents.
There are three accompanying data sets:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>WelshStreams.prey</code>, which gives the mean abundance of each
prey taxon in each of the six streams (counts of individuals from 3â€“min
kick samples)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>WelshStreams.fl</code> which specifies forbidden links (one
forbidden link for each predator species, ruling out cannibalism)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>WelshStreams.order</code> which ranks the 16 prey taxa in
taxonomic order according to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology's
Coded Macroinvertebrate List. This is used for plotting the results.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">WelshStreams
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 85 rows and 18 variables. Each row represents the gut
contents of an individual predator. The first column <code>Stream</code> indicates
which of the six streams each predator was collected from, whilst the second
column indicates which genus the predator belonged to (<em>Dinocras</em> or
<em>Rhyacophila</em>). The remaining 16 columns represent the potential prey
taxa, which were either predated (1) or not (0) by each individual predator.
