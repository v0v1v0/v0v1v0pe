<h2>
Martin-Quinn Judicial Ideology Scores
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains materials related to the Martin-Quinn measures of judicial ideology,
estimated for every justice serving from October 1937 to October 2013.  The materials are
based on the July 23, 2014 (2014 Release 01) release of the Supreme Court Database, which
contain the votes of each Supreme Court justice on each case heard in the court.  The
data is set up for input to <code>dynIRT()</code>, and also includes point estimates of the same
model obtained using standard MCMC techniques.  Start values and priors input to this model
are identical to those used in the MCMC estimates, and were provided by Kevin Quinn. 
</p>
