<h2>Finds cost-effective frontier</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>CEfinder</code> returns cost-effectiveness analysis for a particular set of alternatives.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">CEfinder(benefit, cost)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>benefit</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of restoration benefits. Typically, these are time-averaged
ecological outcomes (e.g., average annual habitat units). Often project benefits
are best presented as the "lift" associated with a restoration action
(i.e., the benefits of an alternative minus the benefits of a "no action" plan).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cost</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of restoration costs. Typically, these are monetary costs
associated with a given restoration action such as project first cost or
annualized economic cost. Notably, these functions are agnostic to units, so costs
could also be non-monetary such as lost political capital or social costs
of each alternative.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector identifying each plan as cost-effective (1) or
non-cost-effective (0). The cost-effective actions comprise the Pareto frontier
of non-dominated alternatives at a given level of cost or benefit.
