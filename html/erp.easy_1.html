<h2>erp.easy: A user-friendly package for exploring event-related potential (ERP) data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>So you've recorded and cleaned (processed) some ERP data... Now what?
If you're not a programmer, or are new to ERPs, the next step may be a bit daunting, or
at the very least, time consuming if done by hand. The erp.easy package provides an
intuitive approach to exploring your processed data, without requiring a background
in computer programming. The erp.easy package provides three categories of functions,
optimized to be easy to use: loading ERP files, plotting ERP data, and analyzing ERP data.
</p>


<h3>Loading functions</h3>

<p>The function <code>load.data</code> exists to save you the hassle of opening each individual
ERP file and adding a header or other identifying information to the files.  This function
expects data formatted with electrodes across the columns and time points as rows. Additional
columns (i.e., "Subject", "Stimulus", and "Time") will be added upon import to help organize your
data. The erp.easy package will use existing headers provided in raw data files to refer to electrodes
for use in functions, or will assign headers if none are present (see <code>load.data</code>.)
Single electrodes can be passed to the package functions, or several electrodes can be provided
(i.e., when using dense arrays) and those electrodes will be averaged together as a single electrode.
See also <code>easy.load</code> for a more user-friendly way to import your data using the erp.easy
data import wizard.
</p>


<h3>Plotting functions</h3>

<p>The plotting functions <code>grandaverage</code>, <code>individual</code>, and
<code>mosaic</code> provide several ways to visualize both grand average and
individual data. Color-coding and labeling happens automatically for ease of use.
</p>


<h3>Analysis functions</h3>

<p>The analysis functions <code>m.measures</code> and <code>p.measures</code> calculate
standard ERP measures such as mean amplitude, standard deviation, peak amplitude and
peak latency for both grand average and individual waveforms.

data(ERPdata)

grandaverage(ERPdata, electrodes = "V78")

mosaic(ERPdata, electrodes = "V78")

m.measures(ERPdata, electrodes = "V78", window = c(1000, 1500))
