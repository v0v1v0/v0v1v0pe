<h2> Mortality data of moth larvae due to increasing doses of
insecticide.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Batches of twenty larvae were exposed to increasing doses of
insecticide, and the number of survivors and their sexes were noted.
These data were reported by Collett(1991) and used by Venables
and Ripley(1994 and later editions). They resulted from an experiment
to study the toxicity of a pyrethroid insecticide to the tobacco
budworm <em>Heliothis virescens</em> of different doses of the insecticide.
