<h2>ExtremeBounds: Extreme Bounds Analysis in R

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>



<p>The package <code>ExtremeBounds</code> performs extreme bounds analysis (EBA), a global sensitivity test that examines the robustness of the association between a dependent variable and a variety of possible determinants. It supports a demanding version of EBA, proposed by Leamer (1985), that focuses on the upper and lower extreme bounds of regression estimates, as well as a more flexible version proposed by Sala-i-Martin (1997). Sala-i-Martin's EBA considers the entire distribution of regression coefficients. For Sala-i-Martin's version of extreme bounds analysis, the package <code>ExtremeBounds</code> estimates results for both the normal model (in which regression coefficients are assumed to be normally distributed across models) and the generic model (where no such assumption is made).
</p>
<p>The most important function is <code>eba</code>, which performs the extreme bounds analysis and stores the results in an object of class <code>"eba"</code>. This object can then be passed on to the <code>print.eba</code> and <code>hist.eba</code> functions to obtain, respectively, a printed summary of EBA results and a set of histograms that illustrate the EBA results graphically.
