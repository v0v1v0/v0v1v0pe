<h2>Aphid data as a BACI design</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A subset from a study of the effects of bird exclusion on biological control of aphids in a German oat
field (Grass <em>et al.</em> 2017). Many thanks to Ingo for providing the raw data. The full data are
in <code>aphids</code>, here we provide just two sampling times, 3 days and 30 days after netting.
OK, this is not quite a BACI design, 3 days after netting is not quite "before" but effects at this 
point should be negligible...
</p>
<p>There were eight plots, four with plastic netting to exclude birds, and four without. Aphid abundance 
was counted on 5 shoots per plot. The expectation was that aphid numbers would decrease on bird 
exclusion, because an important food source to tree sparrows is aphid predators, hoverflies and 
ladybird beetles, so presence of birds may be limit the effectiveness of a biological control of aphids.
