<h2>
Surveillance system sensitivity for detection of disease assuming representative sampling and imperfect test sensitivity and specificity.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the surveillance system (population-level) sensitivity for detection of disease assuming representative sampling and imperfect test sensitivity and specificity.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rsu.sep.rsfreecalc(N, n, c = 1, pstar, se.u, sp.u)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar, integer representing the total number of subjects eligible to be sampled. Use <code>NA</code> if unknown.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar, integer representing the total number of subjects sampled.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>c</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar, integer representing the cut-point number of positives to classify a cluster as positive. If the number of positives is less than <code>c</code> the cluster is negative; if the number of positives is greater than or equal to <code>c</code> the cluster is positive.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pstar</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar, numeric, representing the design prevalence, the hypothetical outcome prevalence to be detected. See details, below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se.u</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar, numeric (0 to 1) representing the diagnostic sensitivity of the test at the unit level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sp.u</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar, numeric (0 to 1) representing the diagnostic specificity of the test at the unit level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If a value for <code>N</code> is entered surveillance system sensitivity is calculated using the hypergeometric distribution. If <code>N</code> is <code>NA</code> surveillance system sensitivity is calculated using the binomial distribution.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A scalar representing the surveillance system (population-level) sensitivity.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1:
## Thirty animals from a herd of 150 are to be tested using a test with
## diagnostic sensitivity 0.90 and specificity 0.98. What is the 
## surveillance system sensitivity assuming a design prevalence of 0.10 and 
## two or more positive tests will be interpreted as a positive result?

rsu.sep.rsfreecalc(N = 150, n = 30, c = 2, pstar = 0.10, 
   se.u = 0.90, sp.u = 0.98)

## If a random sample of 30 animals is taken from a population of 150 and 
## a positive test result is defined as two or more individuals returning 
## a positive test, the probability of detecting disease if the population is 
## diseased at a prevalence of 0.10 is 0.87.


## EXAMPLE 2:
## Repeat these calculations assuming herd size is unknown:

rsu.sep.rsfreecalc(N = NA, n = 30, c = 2, pstar = 0.10, 
   se.u = 0.90, sp.u = 0.98)

## If a random sample of 30 animals is taken from a population of unknown size 
## and a positive test result is defined as two or more individuals returning 
## a positive test, the probability of detecting disease if the population is 
## diseased at a prevalence of 0.10 is 0.85.
