<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This CSV dataset (AMD_baseline_MEH_v1.csv) is associated with the paper Moraes et al

macular degeneration using deep learning. Ophthalmology. (2020).
The dataset comprises anonymised metadata and OCT segmentation data of patients
undergoing treatment for wet AMD at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom.
The dataset includes 2966 rows (2966 individual patients)

<h3>Missing values</h3>

<p>There are 233 missing visual acuity entries in this data set. They result
from data entry errors (ETDRS values above 100) and missing data in the original
medical health records.
</p>


<h3>Study setting and design</h3>

<p>Study setting and design: This study is a retrospective cohort study of
patients that commenced anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD
between June 2012 and June 2017 at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,
London, UK.
Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital
(ROAD17/031). The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki
</p>


<h3>Data source</h3>

<p>All clinical information at Moorfields Eye Hospital is recorded within an
electronic medical record (EMR) application (OpenEyes Foundation, London, UK).
A SQL database (SQL Server Reporting Service, Microsoft Corporation, Richmond, USA)
containing all the information from the EMR is in place and regular updates
are performed overnight to keep the data warehouse up-to-date.
VA is reported in ETDRS letter score (and categories for ETDRS &lt; 1). The highest value (independent of
measurement method) available at each visit was chosen.
</p>


<h3>OCT</h3>

<p>Each voxel equates to 2.60 x 11.72 x 47.24 microns in the A-scan, B-scan, and
C-scan directions, respectively. All OCT data is captured using 3DOCT-2000
devices (Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). All images comprise 512 x 885 x 128 voxels
covering a volume of 6x6x2.3mm. In this dataset, only one image is available
per eye. The image with the lowest segmented artifacts was chosen if multiple
scans were available at the same visit.
</p>


<h3>Time variable</h3>

<p>For first-treated eyes, time will generally equal 0. Where a scan at day 0
was not available, a scan up to 14 days prior to the first
injection (i.e. up to -14 days), is used for analysis.
</p>


<h3>Segmentation</h3>

<p>Segmentation data was output using a deep learning segmentation model described
further in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0107-6">De Fauw et al.</a> and
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0867-7">Yim and Chopra et al.</a>
