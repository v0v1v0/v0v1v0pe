<h2>Estimated marginal means of linear trends</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>emtrends</code> function is useful when a fitted model involves a
numerical predictor <code class="reqn">x</code>  interacting with another predictor <code>a</code>
(typically a factor). Such models specify that <code class="reqn">x</code> has a different trend
depending on <code class="reqn">a</code>; thus, it may be of interest to estimate and compare
those trends. Analogous to the <code>emmeans</code> setting, we construct a
reference grid of these predicted trends, and then possibly average them over
some of the predictors in the grid.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">emtrends(object, specs, var, delta.var = 0.001 * rng, max.degree = 1, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>A supported model object (<em>not</em> a reference grid)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>specs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifications for what marginal trends are desired – as in
<code>emmeans</code>. If <code>specs</code> is missing or <code>NULL</code>,
<code>emmeans</code> is not run and the reference grid for specified trends
is returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character value giving the name of a variable with respect to 
which a difference quotient of the linear predictors is computed. In order
for this to be useful, <code>var</code> should be a numeric predictor that
interacts with at least one factor in <code>specs</code>. Then instead of
computing EMMs, we compute and compare the slopes of the <code>var</code> trend
over levels of the specified other predictor(s). As in EMMs, marginal
averages are computed for the predictors in <code>specs</code> and <code>by</code>.
See also the “Generalizations” section below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delta.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>The value of <em>h</em> to use in forming the difference
quotient <code class="reqn">(f(x+h) - f(x))/h</code>. Changing it (especially changing its
sign) may be necessary to avoid numerical problems such as logs of negative
numbers. The default value is 1/1000 of the range of <code>var</code> over the
dataset.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max.degree</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer value. The maximum degree of trends to compute (this
is capped at 5). If greater than 1, an additional factor <code>degree</code> is
added to the grid, with corresponding numerical derivatives of orders
<code>1, 2, ..., max.degree</code> as the estimates.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function works by constructing reference grids for <code>object</code> with 
various values of <code>var</code>, and then calculating difference quotients of predictions
from those reference grids. Finally, <code>emmeans</code> is called with
the given <code>specs</code>, thus computing marginal averages as needed of
the difference quotients. Any <code>...</code> arguments are passed to the
<code>ref_grid</code> and <code>emmeans</code>; examples of such optional
arguments include optional arguments (often <code>mode</code>) that apply to
specific models; <code>ref_grid</code> options such as <code>data</code>, <code>at</code>,
<code>cov.reduce</code>, <code>mult.names</code>, <code>nesting</code>, or <code>transform</code>;
and <code>emmeans</code> options such as <code>weights</code> (but please avoid
<code>trend</code> or <code>offset</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code>emmGrid</code> or <code>emm_list</code> object, according to <code>specs</code>.
See <code>emmeans</code> for more details on when a list is returned.
</p>


<h3>Generalizations</h3>

<p>Instead of a single predictor, the user may specify some monotone function of
one variable, e.g., <code>var = "log(dose)"</code>. If so, the chain rule is
applied. Note that, in this example, if <code>object</code> contains
<code>log(dose)</code> as a predictor, we will be comparing the slopes estimated by
that model, whereas specifying <code>var = "dose"</code> would perform a
transformation of those slopes, making the predicted trends vary depending on
<code>dose</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In earlier versions of <code>emtrends</code>, the first argument was named
<code>model</code> rather than <code>object</code>. (The name was changed because of
potential mis-matching with a <code>mode</code> argument, which is an option for
several types of models.) For backward compatibility, <code>model</code> still works
<em>provided all arguments are named</em>.
</p>
<p>It is important to understand that trends computed by <code>emtrends</code> are
<em>not</em> equivalent to polynomial contrasts in a parallel model where
<code>var</code> is regarded as a factor. That is because the model <code>object</code>
here is assumed to fit a smooth function of <code>var</code>, and the estimated
trends reflect <em>local</em> behavior at particular value(s) of <code>var</code>;
whereas when <code>var</code> is modeled as a factor and polynomial contrasts are
computed, those contrasts represent the <em>global</em> pattern of changes over
<em>all</em> levels of <code>var</code>. 
</p>
<p>See the <code>pigs.poly</code> and <code>pigs.fact</code> examples below for an
illustration. The linear and quadratic trends depend on the value of 
<code>percent</code>, but the cubic trend is constant (because that is true of
a cubic polynomial, which is the underlying model). The cubic contrast
in the factorial model has the same P value as for the cubic trend,
again because the cubic trend is the same everywhere.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fiber.lm &lt;- lm(strength ~ diameter*machine, data=fiber)
# Obtain slopes for each machine ...
( fiber.emt &lt;- emtrends(fiber.lm, "machine", var = "diameter") )

# Suppose we want trends relative to sqrt(diameter)...
emtrends(fiber.lm, ~ machine | diameter, var = "sqrt(diameter)",

# Obtaining a reference grid
mtcars.lm &lt;- lm(mpg ~ poly(disp, degree = 2) * (factor(cyl) + factor(am)), data = mtcars)

# Center trends at mean disp for each no. of cylinders
mtcTrends.rg &lt;- emtrends(mtcars.lm, var = "disp",

                at = list(percent = c(9, 13.5, 18)))
