<h2>Glass dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains the description of 214 fragments of glass originally
collected for a study in the context of criminal investigation. Each fragment has a measured
reflectivity index and chemical composition (weight percent of Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba and Fe).
As suggested by Ripley (1994), 29 instances were discarded, and the remaining 185
were re-grouped in four classes: window float glass (70), window non-float glass (76), vehicle window
glass (17) and other (22). The data set was split randomly in a training set of size 89 and a test
set of size 96.
