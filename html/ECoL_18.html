<h2>Measures of neighborhood</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Classification task. The Neighborhood measures analyze the neighborhoods of 
the data items and try to capture class overlapping and the shape of the 
decision boundary. They work over a distance matrix storing the distances 
between all pairs of data points in the dataset.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">neighborhood(...)

## Default S3 method:
neighborhood(x, y, measures = "all",
  summary = c("mean", "sd"), ...)

## S3 method for class 'formula'
neighborhood(formula, data, measures = "all",
  summary = c("mean", "sd"), ...)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following measures are allowed for this method:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>"N1"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fraction of borderline points (N1) computes the percentage of 
vertexes incident to edges connecting examples of opposite classes in 
a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).</p>
</dd>
<dt>"N2"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ratio of intra/extra class nearest neighbor distance (N2)  
computes the ratio of two sums: intra-class and inter-class. The former 
corresponds to the sum of the distances between each example and its 
closest neighbor from the same class. The later is the sum of the 
distances between each example and its closest neighbor from another 
class (nearest enemy).</p>
</dd>
<dt>"N3"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Error rate of the nearest neighbor (N3) classifier corresponds
to the error rate of a one Nearest Neighbor (1NN) classifier, estimated 
using a leave-one-out procedure in dataset.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"N4"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Non-linearity of the nearest neighbor classifier (N4) creates 
a new dataset randomly interpolating pairs of training examples of the 
same class and then induce a the 1NN classifier on the original data and
measure the error rate in the new data points.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"T1"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fraction of hyperspheres covering data (T1) builds 
hyperspheres centered at each one of the training examples, which have 
their radios growth until the hypersphere reaches an example of another 
class. Afterwards, smaller hyperspheres contained in larger hyperspheres 
are eliminated. T1 is finally defined as the ratio between the number of 
the remaining hyperspheres and the total number of examples in the 
dataset.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"LSC"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Local Set Average Cardinality (LSC) is based on Local Set 
(LS) and defined as the set of points from the dataset whose distance of
each example is smaller than the distance from the exemples of the 
different class. LSC is the average of the LS.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list named by the requested neighborhood measure.
