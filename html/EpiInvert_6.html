<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>EpiInvertForecast</code> computes a 28-day forecast of the restored incidence 
curve including a 95
using the weekly seasonality, from the forecasted restored incidence curve we
also estimate a  28-day forecast of the original incidence curve.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">EpiInvertForecast(
  EpiInvert_result,
  restored_incidence_database,
  type = "median",
  trend_sentiment = 0,
  NumberForecastAdditionalDays = 0
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>EpiInvert_result</code></td>
<td>
<p>output list of the EpiInvert execution including, in particular,
the restored incidence curve and the seasonality.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>restored_incidence_database</code></td>
<td>
<p>a database including 27,418  samples of different
restored incidence curves computed by EpiInvert using real data. Each 
restored incidence curve includes the last 56 values of the sequence. That is
this database can be viewed as a matrix of size 27,418  X 56</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>string with the forecast option. It can be "mean" or "median".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trend_sentiment</code></td>
<td>
<p>"a priori" knowledge about the future incidence evolution. 
== 0 means that you are neutral about the future trend 
&gt; 0  means that you expect that the future trend is higher than the expected one 
using all database curves. the value represents the percentage of database 
curves removed before computing the forecast The curves removed are the ones 
with lowest growth in the last 28 days.  
&lt; 0  means that you expect that the future trend is higher than the expected one 
using all database curves. the meaning of the value is similar to the previous 
case, but removing the curves with the highest growth in the last 28 days.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>NumberForecastAdditionalDays</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of forecast days is 28. With this
parameter you can add extra forecast days using linear extrapolation.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>EpiInvertForecast estimates a forecast of the restored incidence curve 
using a weighted average of 27,418  restored incidence curves previously 
estimated by EpiInvert and stored in the database "restored_incidence_database". 
The weight, in the average computation, of each restored incidence curve 
of the database depends on the similarity between the current curve in the last
28 days and the first 28 days of the database curve. Each database curve 
contains 56 days. The first 28 days are used for comparison with the current 
curve and the last 28 days are used for forecasting.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>


<p>a list with components:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>dates: a vector of dates corresponding to the forecast days. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i_restored_forecast: a numeric vector with the forecast of the 
restored incidence curve for the next 28 days.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i_original_forecast: a numeric vector with the forecast of the 
original incidence curve for the next 28 days.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i_restored_forecast_CI50: radius of an empiric confidence interval,  
with percentile 50, for the restored incidence forecast following the 
number of days passed since the current day. 

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i_restored_forecast_CI75: radius of an empiric confidence interval,  
with percentile 75, for the restored incidence forecast following the 
number of days passed since the current day. 

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i_restored_forecast_CI90: radius of an empiric confidence interval,  
with percentile 90, for the restored incidence forecast following the 
number of days passed since the current day. 

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i_restored_forecast_CI95: radius of an empiric confidence interval,  
with percentile 95, for the restored incidence forecast following the 
number of days passed since the current day.
