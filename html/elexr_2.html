<h2>Load Associated Press Election Results with Elex</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides R access to election results data. Wraps elex (https://github.com/newsdev/elex/), a Python package and command line tool for fetching and parsing Associated Press election results.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A light R wrapper around the elex command
</p>
<p>elexr provides an R interface for the elex package 
(http://github.com/newsdev/elex/) to load election results from the 
Associated Press Elections API.
</p>
<p>Rather than reinventing the wheel, this package simply runs <code>elex</code> in
a shell and loads the CSV output into a data frame.  Because of this,
you'll need Python and to install elex by following the instructions at 
<a href="http://elex.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html">http://elex.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html</a>.
</p>
<p>You'll also need an API key for the API Elections API.  You'll need to set
the <code>AP_API_KEY</code> environtment variable in your R session to be able to
retreive results.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(elexr)
# Set your actual AP Elections API Key here. The string below is an example
# only and won't work.
Sys.setenv(AP_API_KEY = "AZA0AZ0aZ0ZA0az0AzAZ0AzazAzaZaZAZ")
tryCatch({
    ia_results &lt;- results("02-01-2016")
},
error = function(err) {
    print(err)
})
  
</code></pre>
