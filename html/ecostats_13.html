<h2>Guineapig data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data derived from a study of the effects of nicotine on the development of guineapig offspring (Johns et al 1993).
Ten pregnant guineapigs were injected with nicotine hydrogen tartite solution, and
ten control guinea pigs were injected with saline solution as a control. Learning capabilities
of offspring were then measured as the number of errors made when trying to remember
where to find food in a simple maze. Data presented  are not from the original paper- they have been generated to match the summary statistics reported in Johns et al (1993).
