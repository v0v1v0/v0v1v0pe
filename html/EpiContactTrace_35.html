<h2>Generate a contact tracing <code>Report</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>EpiContatTrace contains report templates to generate pdf- or html
reports for the farm specific contacts. These reports can be
useful for hands-on disease tracing in the field. The templates
are used by Sweave and can be adapted by the end user. However, in
the default setting the report has the following layout; first the
contacts are visualised graphically in a plot, as to give an
immediate signal to the reader of the report of the number of
contacts. In the following, the contact data are presented with
different levels of detail split by ingoing and outgoing
contacts. The first includes collapsed data and the sequential
contact structure at group level (i.e. no information on
individuals or dates). In this summary, the sequential structure
of each part of the chain is included, and a holding that appears
in several different parts of the chain can therefore be included
more than once in the summary. The reason for this is to
facilitate sequential tracing and getting an overview of each part
of the chain. After the summary all details of all contacts
included in the contact chains is presented, i.e. date of contact
and data on individual level when available. To generate pdf files
a TeX installation must exist to compile the latex file. The
report is saved in the working directory with the name of the root
as filename.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Report(object, format = c("html", "pdf"), dir = ".", template = NULL)

## S4 method for signature 'ContactTrace'
Report(object, format = c("html", "pdf"), dir = ".", template = NULL)

## S4 method for signature 'list'
Report(object, format = c("html", "pdf"), dir = ".", template = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>the object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
<p>the format to use, can be either 'html' or
'pdf'. The default is 'html'</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>the generated report is written to the directory
folder. The default (<code>"."</code>) is the current working
directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>template</code></td>
<td>
<p>the Sweave template file to use. If none is
provided, the default is used.</p>
</td>
