<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>com, initial</code></td>
<td>

<p>starting community. It is in principle a three (or more) column matrix or
data.frame including individual ID, species names and trait values. For strictly
neutral dynamics, it can be a vector of individual species names.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prob, prob.of.immigrate, prob.of.mutate</code></td>
<td>

<p>probability of an individual establishing in the community not being a
descendant of an existing individual. If descendant from a new ancestor, can be
either through immigration (in <code>pick.immigrate()</code>) or through mutation
(in <code>pick.mutate()</code>).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of individuals that die in each time-step.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gens</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of generations to simulate.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep</code></td>
<td>

<p>boolean value. If <code>FALSE</code> (default) the function output only the community
composition at the end of the simulation. If <code>TRUE</code> the function output a
list of community composition at successive time steps (see Value section).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pool</code></td>
<td>

<p>the regional pool of species providing immigrants to the local community. It is
in principle a three-column matrix or data frame including individual ID,
species names and trait values. If trait information is missing, a random trait
value is given to individuals, from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
If <code>NULL</code>, the pool is simulated as a metacommunity at speciation-drift
equilibrium, based on <code>prob</code> for speciation rate.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>given_size</code></td>
<td>

<p>size of the community you want to have an estimate of the number of generations
needed to reach stationarity in species richness.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nbrep</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of replicates from which you want to estimate the number of generations
needed to reach stationarity in species richness.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>limit.sim</code></td>
<td>

<p>if <code>TRUE,</code> limiting similarity will be simulated, based on species trait
distances (computed with the method given by <code>method.dist</code>) and a Gaussian
overlapping function. 
</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coeff.lim.sim</code></td>
<td>

<p>adjust the intensity of limiting similarity. 
</p>

similarity.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filt</code></td>
<td>

<p>the function used to represent habitat filtering. For a given trait value
<code>t</code>, <code>filt(t)</code> represents the probability that an individual with
trait <code>t</code> enters the local community.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prob.death</code></td>
<td>

<p>provides a baseline probability of death that is homogeneous across species. It
is used in niche-based dynamics to represent the balance of baseline and
niche-dependent mortality.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method.dist</code></td>
<td>

<p>provide the method to compute trait distances between individuals (syntax of
function <code>dist</code>, can be in the list <code>c("euclidean",

"canberra", "binary", "minkowski")</code>).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It is a zero-sum game, so that the number of individuals of the community is
fixed to the number of individuals in initial community.
</p>
<p>When niche-based dynamics are simulated, the niche-based constraints influence
both immigration and mortality.
</p>
<p>Function <code>get_number_of_gen()</code> allows determining the number of generations
needed to reach stationary richness for given parameterization of
<code>forward()</code>. The target number of generation is based on assessing the
change point in species richness change over time for replicate simulated
communities with random initial composition. A conservative measure is proposed
as the maximum time to reach stationary richness over the replicate simulated
communities.
</p>
<p>Functions <code>pick.immigrate()</code> and <code>pick.mutate()</code> are used to simulate
immigration and speciation events within a time step. They are embedded in
forward and are not really intended for the end user. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>com</code></td>
<td>

<p>if <code>keep = FALSE</code>, a data.frame of simulated individuals, with the label
of ancestor individual in the regional pool on first column (as in the first
column of the pool), species label on second column (as in the second column of
the pool), and species trait (as in the third column of the pool).
