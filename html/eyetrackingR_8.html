<h2>Clean data by removing high-trackloss trials/subjects.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Remove trials/participants with too much trackloss, with a customizable threshold.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">clean_by_trackloss(
  data,
  participant_prop_thresh = 1,
  trial_prop_thresh = 1,
  window_start_time = -Inf,
  window_end_time = Inf
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data already run through <code>make_eyetrackingr_data</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>participant_prop_thresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum proportion of trackloss for participants</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trial_prop_thresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum proportion of trackloss for trials</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window_start_time, window_end_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>Time-window within which you want trackloss analysis to
be based. Allows you to keep the entire trial window for data, but clean based on the trackloss
within a subset of it</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Cleaned data
</p>
