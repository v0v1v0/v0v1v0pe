<h2>eicm: Explicit Interaction Community Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Explicit Interaction Community Models
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Model fitting and species biotic interaction network topology selection for explicit interaction community models.
Explicit interaction community models are an extension of binomial linear models for joint modelling of species
communities, that incorporate both the effects of species biotic interactions and the effects of missing covariates.
Species interactions are modelled as direct effects of each species on each of the others, and are estimated
alongside the effects of missing covariates, modelled as latent factors.
The package includes a penalized maximum likelihood fitting function, and a genetic algorithm for selecting
the most parsimonious species interaction network topology.
