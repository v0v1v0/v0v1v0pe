</p>
</li>

<p> _only_node:xyz Restricts the search to execute only on a node with the provided
node id (xyz in this case).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> _prefer_node:xyz Prefers execution on the node with the provided node

</li>
<li>
<p> _shards:2,3 Restricts the operation to the specified shards. (2 and 3 in this case).
This preference can be combined with other preferences but it has to appear
first: _shards:2,3;_primary
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Custom (string) value A custom value will be used to guarantee that the same shards
will be used for the same custom value. This can help with "jumping values" when hitting
different shards in different refresh states. A sample value can be something like the web
session id, or the user name.
