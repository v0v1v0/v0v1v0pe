<h2>List of datasets containing the Farrington Flexible and GLRNB default parameters by time unit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list including two datasets containing the parameters used for Farrington Flexible and for GLRNB
for each time unit available in the Signal Detection tool
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">AlgoParam
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of 2 dataframes: one with 2 rows and 9 variables and GRLNB with 2 rows and 8 variables
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><strong>Default parameters for FarringtonFlexible algorithm</strong>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>timeunit</dt>
<dd>
<p>Time units available in the signal detection tool i.e. week, month</p>
</dd>
<dt>w</dt>
<dd>
<p>Window's half-size, i.e. number of weeks to include before and after the current week in each year
(w=2 for weeks, w=1 for months)</p>
</dd>
<dt>reweight</dt>
<dd>
<p>Logical specifying whether to reweight past outbreaks or not
(TRUE for both weeks and months, past outbreaks are always reweighted)</p>
</dd>
<dt>trend</dt>
<dd>
<p>Logical specifying whether a trend should be included and kept
in case the conditions in the Farrington et. al. paper are met.
(TRUE for both weeks and months, a trend is always fit)</p>
</dd>
<dt>weightsThreshold</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric defining the threshold for reweighting past outbreaks
using the Anscombe residuals
(2.85 for both weeks and months, as advised in the improved method)</p>
</dd>
<dt>glmWarnings</dt>
<dd>
<p>Logical specifying whether to print warnings from the call to glm
(TRUE for both weeks and months)</p>
</dd>
<dt>pThresholdTrend</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric defining the threshold for deciding whether to keep trend in the model
(0.05 for both weeks and months)</p>
</dd>
<dt>limit54_1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Integer, the number of cases defining a threshold for minimum alarm,
no alarm is sounded if fewer than 'limit54_1' cases were reported in the past 'limit54_2' weeks/months</p>
</dd>
<dt>limit54_2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Integer, the number of periods defining a threshold for minimum alarm,
no alarm is sounded if fewer than 'limit54_1' cases were reported in the past 'limit54_2' weeks/months</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Default parameters for GLRNB algorithm</strong>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>timeunit</dt>
<dd>
<p>Time units available in the signal detection tool i.e. week, month</p>
</dd>
<dt>mu0</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of in-control values of the mean of the Poisson / negative binomial distribution
with the same length as range
- NULL for both weeks and months</p>
</dd>
<dt>theta</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric, the pre-specified value for k or lambda is used in a recursive LR scheme
- log(1.2) for both weeks and months corresponding to a 20 percent increase in the mean</p>
</dd>
<dt>alpha</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric, the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial distribution.
If alpha=NULL the parameter is calculated as part of the in-control estimation
- alpha=NULL for both weeks and months</p>
</dd>
<dt>cARL</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric, the threshold in the GLR test, i.e. c_gamma - cARL=0.25 for both weeks and months</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mtilde</dt>
<dd>
<p>Integer, the number of observations needed before we have a full rank
- Mtilde=1 for both weeks and months</p>
</dd>
<dt>M</dt>
<dd>
<p>Integer defining the number of time instances back in time in the window-limited approach.
To always look back until the first observation use M=-1. M=1 for both weeks and months</p>
</dd>
<dt>Change</dt>
<dd>
<p>Character string specifying the type of the alternative.
Currently the two choices are intercept and epi
- Change=intercept for both weeks and months</p>
</dd>
