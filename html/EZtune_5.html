<h2>Mullein data from Lava Beds National Monument</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains information about the presence and absence of
common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) at Lava Beds National Monument.
The park was digitally divided into 30m by 30m pixels. Park personnel
provided data on 6,047 sites at which mullein was detected and treated
between 2000 and 2005, and these data were augmented by 6,047 randomly
selected pseudo-absences. For each 30m by 30m site there are data on
elevation, aspect, slope, proximity to roads and trails, and interpolated
bioclimatic variables such as minimum, maximum, and average temperature,
precipitation, relative humidity, and evapotranspiration. The dataset
called mulleinTest is a test dataset collected in Lava Beds National
Monument in 2006 that can be used to verify evaluate predictive statistical
procedures applied to the mullein dataset.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mullein

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 12,094 observations and 32 variables. One variable
identifies the presence or absence of mullein in a 30m by 30m site and 31
variables are characteristics of the site where the data were collected.
</p>
<p>In the original data there were 12 monthly values for each of the
bioclimatic predictors. Principal components analyses suggested that for
each of these predictors 2 principal components explained the vast
majority (95.0% - 99.5%) of the total variability. Based on these analyses,
indices were created for each set of bioclimatic predictors. The
variables with the suffix Ave in the variable name are the average of
12 monthly variables. The variables with the suffix Diff are contrasts
between the sum of the April-September monthly values and the sum of the
October-December and January-March monthly values, divided by 12. Roughly
speaking, these are summer-to-winter contrasts.
The variables are summarized as follows:
