<h2> Rotating Rats Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The endurance time of 24 rats in two groups in a rotating cylinder.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(rotarod)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 24 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>
<p>the endurance time</p>
</dd>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>control</code> and <code>treatment</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The 24 rats received a fixed oral dose of a centrally acting muscle relaxant
(treatment) or a saline solvent (control). They were placed on a rotating
cylinder and the length of time each rat remains on the cylinder is
measured, up to a maximum of 300 seconds.
The rats were randomly assigned to the control and treatment group.
</p>
<p>Note that the empirical variance in the control group is 0 and that the
group medians are identical.
</p>
<p>This dataset serves as the basis of an comparision of the results of the 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test computed by 11 statistical packages in Bergmann
et al. (2000). The exact conditional p-value is $0.0373$ (two-sided) and
$0.0186$ (one-sided). The asymptotic two-sided 
p-value (corrected for ties) is reported as $0.0147$.
