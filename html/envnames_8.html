<h2>Crawl environments in search of user environments</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function that crawls a set of environments to search for user environments
defined within each of them.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">crawl_envs(env_names, path, path_to_envs_found, rootenvir = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>env_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>array with the environment names where the search for environments is wished
(careful: should not contain the environment *objects* but their *names*!).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>array with user environment names leading to the current set of
environments listed in <code>env_names</code>. Ex: <code>c("env_of_envs", "env11")</code> which means that the
the environments listed in <code>env_names</code> exist in environment <code>env_of_envs$env11</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path_to_envs_found</code></td>
<td>
<p>array of user environment names found so far including their path
where the path is allowed to include ONLY user environments.
(e.g. an element of the <code>path_to_envs_found</code> array could be <code>"env1$env2$env"</code>, but NOT
<code>"R_GlobalEnv$env1$env2"</code>, because "R_GobalEnv" is the name of a system environment, NOT a
user environment).
The first time this function is called it should contain the empty array.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rootenvir</code></td>
<td>
<p>environment used as starting point for the user environment
search process. If <code>NULL</code>, the environment is taken from the names attribute of
the <code>env_names</code> parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function crawls the user environments defined in the <code>rootenvir</code> environment and
any user environments within those user environments until no user environment
has been left without visit, making up a tree of nested user environments.
The path to each user environment found is stored using the <code>$</code> notation as in
<code>env1$env12$envx</code>.
</p>
<p>Instead of setting the <code>rootenvir</code> parameter to the root environment where the search should start,
a similar result is obtained by setting the <code>path</code> variable to the environment chain leading to
the environments passed in <code>env_names</code>, as in e.g. <code>c("env_of_envs", "env11")</code>.
The difference is that such environment will appear as part of the paths to the environments passed,
and in addition, it is assumed that such environment is an actual environment.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An array containing the path to each user environment found inside the <code>rootenvir</code>
environment and all the nested user environments found within each of them.
This array is concatenated to whatever paths are already listed in the <code>path_to_envs_found</code>
parameter passed to the function.
