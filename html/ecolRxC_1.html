This argument allows the eight options discussed in Pavia (2022)
as well as an adjusting option. This argument admits nine values: <code>adjust</code>,

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Description of the <code>census.changes</code> argument in more detail.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>adjust</code>: The default value. This is the simplest solution for handling discrepancies
between the total number of counts for the first and second elections.
With this value the J1 column-aggregations of the counts
in <code>votes.election1</code> of the first election are proportionally adjusted to
equal the aggregation of the counts in <code>votes.election2</code> of the second election.
In this scenario, J is equal to J1 and K equal to K2.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>raw</code>: This argument accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least
some months where only the raw election data recorded in the I (territorial) units,
in which the electoral space under study is divided, are available and net
entries and net exits are approached from the available information.
In this scenario, net exits and net entries are estimated according to
Pavia (2022). When both net entries and exits are no
null, constraint (15) of Pavia (2022) applies: no transfer between entries and
exits are allowed. In this scenario, J could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to
K2 or K2 + 1.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>simultaneous</code>: This is the value to be used in classical ecological inference problems,
such as in ecological studies of social or racial voting, and in scenarios with two simultaneous elections.
In this scenario, the sum by rows of <code>votes.election1</code> and <code>votes.election2</code> must coincide.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>regular</code>: This value accounts for a scenario with
two elections elapsed at least some months where (i) the column J1
of <code>votes.election1</code> corresponds to new (young) electors who have the right
to vote for the first time, (ii) net exits and maybe other additional
net entries are computed according to Pavia (2022). When both net entries and exits
are no null, constraints (13) and (15) of Pavia (2022) apply. In this scenario, J
could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ordinary</code>: This value accounts for a scenario
with two elections elapsed at least some months where (i) the column K1
of <code>votes.election2</code> corresponds to electors who died in the interperiod
election, (ii) net entries and maybe other additional net exits are
computed according to Pavia (2022). When both net entries and net exits are no null,
constraints (14) and (15) of Pavia (2022) apply.
In this scenario, J could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>enriched</code>: This value accounts for a scenario that somewhat combine <code>regular</code> and
<code>ordinary</code> scenarios. We consider two elections elapsed at least some months where
(i) the column J1 of <code>votes.election1</code> corresponds to new (young) electors
who have the right to vote for the first time, (ii) the column K2 of
<code>votes.election2</code> corresponds to electors who died in the interperiod
election, (iii) other (net) entries and (net) exits are computed according
to Pavia (2022). When both net entries and net exits are no null, constraints (12) to
(15) of Pavia (2022) apply. In this scenario, J could be equal
to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>semifull</code>: This value accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least some
months, where: (i) the column J1 = J of <code>votes.election1</code> totals new
electors (young and immigrants) that have the right to vote for the first time in each polling unit and
(ii) the column K2 = K of <code>votes.election2</code> corresponds to total exits of the census
lists (due to death or emigration). In this scenario, the sum by rows of
<code>votes.election1</code> and <code>votes.election2</code> must agree and constraint (15)
of Pavia (2022) apply.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>full</code>: This value accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least some
months, where J = J1, K = K2 and (i) the column J - 1 of <code>votes.election1</code> totals new (young)
electors that have the right to vote for the first time, (ii) the column J
of <code>votes.election1</code> measures new immigrants that have the right to vote and
(iii) the column K of <code>votes.election2</code> corresponds to total exits of the census
lists (due to death or emigration). In this scenario, the sum by rows of
<code>votes.election1</code> and <code>votes.election2</code> must agree and constraints (13)
and (15) of Pavia (2022) apply.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>gold</code>: This value accounts for a scenario similar to <code>full</code>, where J = J1, K = K2 and
total exits are separated out between exits due to emigration
(column K - 1 of <code>votes.election2</code>) and death (column K of <code>votes.election2</code>).
In this scenario, the sum by rows of <code>votes.election1</code> and <code>votes.election2</code> must agree.
Constraints (12) to (15) of Pavia (2022) apply.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
