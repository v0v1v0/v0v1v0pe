<h2>Compute E-value for a difference of means and its confidence interval limits</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame containing point estimates, the lower confidence limit,
and the upper confidence limit on the risk ratio scale (through an
approximate conversion) as well as E-values for the point estimate and the
confidence interval limit closer to the null.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">evalues.MD(est, se = NA, true = 0, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>est</code></td>
<td>
<p>The point estimate as a standardized difference (i.e., Cohen's d)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se</code></td>
<td>
<p>The standard error of the point estimate</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>true</code></td>
<td>
<p>The true standardized mean difference to which to shift the
observed point estimate. Typically set to 0 to consider a null true effect.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Regarding the continuous outcome, the function uses the effect-size conversions in Chinn (2000)
and VanderWeele (2017) to approximately convert the mean difference between the exposed versus unexposed groups
to the odds ratio that would arise from dichotomizing the continuous outcome.
</p>
<p>For example, if resulting E-value is 2, this means that unmeasured confounder(s) would need to double
the probability of a subject's being exposed versus not being exposed, and would also need to
double the probability of being high versus low on the outcome, in which the cutoff for "high" versus
"low" is arbitrary subject to some distributional assumptions (Chinn, 2000).
