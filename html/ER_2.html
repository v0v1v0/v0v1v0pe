<h2>Diabetes data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with a design and transcriptomic data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Diabetes)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Clinical study on humans was performed as a 2-way factorial design with two factors
both on two levels: bariatric surgery on two levels (before and after the bariatric
surgery) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) on two levels (with and without T2D). There were
8 patients without T2D and 7 with T2D. It was discovered that the patients with T2D
would be separated in two groups: 3 patients in the group called T2D1 and 4 patients
in the group called T2D2. The experiment can therefore also analysed as 2 way factorial
design where the disease factor is on three levels. All patients were obese before
bariatric surgery (BMI &gt;45). Transcriptome in the subcutaneous adipose tissue were
obtained before and one year after bariatric surgery.
