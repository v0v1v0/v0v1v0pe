<h2>An example of phenotype data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ExamplePhenoData is a simulated vector of phenotype for 1000 individuals.
In this simulated example dataset, we have considered two tissues and corresponding
sets of 100 tissue-specific eQTLs each.
First half of 1000 individuals' phenotypes were simulated to have genetic effect from the first tissue
specific eQTLs, but no effect from the second tissue-specific eQTLs. Hence first 500 individuals
were assigned to the first tissue. Similarly, second half of
the 1000 individuals were simulated to have genetic effect from the second-tissue specific eQTLs and hence
they were assigned to the second tissue.
