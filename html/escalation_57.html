<h2>Number of nodes in dose-paths analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Number of possible nodes in an exhaustive analysis of dose-paths in a
dose-finding trial. The number of nodes at depth i is the the number of nodes
at depth i-1 multiplied by the number of possible cohort outcomes at depth i.
For instance, if there were 16 nodes at the previous depth and four possible
cohort outcomes at the current depth, then there are 64 possible nodes at the
current depth. Knowing the number of nodes in a dose-paths analysis helps the
analyst decide whether simulation or dose-paths are a better tool for
assessing operating characteristics of a dose-finding design.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">num_dose_path_nodes(num_patient_outcomes, cohort_sizes)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>num_patient_outcomes</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer, number of distinct possible outcomes for
each single patient</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cohort_sizes</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer vector of cohort sizes</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>integer vector, number of nodes at increasing depths. The total
number of nodes is the sum of this vector.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># In a 3+3 design, there are two possible outcomes for each patient and
# patients are evaluated in cohorts of three. In an analysis of dose-paths in
# the first two cohorts of three, how many nodes are there?
num_dose_path_nodes(num_patient_outcomes = 2, cohort_sizes = rep(3, 2))
# In contrast, using an EffTox design there are four possible outcomes for
# each patient. In a similar analysis of dose-paths in the first two cohorts
# of three, how many nodes are there now?
num_dose_path_nodes(num_patient_outcomes = 4, cohort_sizes = rep(3, 2))
