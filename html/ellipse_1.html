<h2>
Functions for drawing ellipses and ellipse-like confidence
regions
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains various routines for drawing
ellipses and ellipse-like confidence regions, implementing the
plots described in Murdoch and Chow (1996).
</p>
<p>There are also routines implementing
the profile plots described in Bates and Watts (1988).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are three groups of routines in the ellipse package.  The first
consists of those involved with <code>plotcorr</code>, which implements the plots
described in Murdoch and Chow (1996). These display correlations using
ellipses, whose shape is that of the contours of a bivariate normal
distribution with matching correlation.
</p>
<p>The second group implements a version of the profile plots described in
Bates and Watts (1988); see <code>ellipse.profile</code> and <code>pairs.profile</code>.
</p>
<p>The last group provide the basis for the others, drawing ellipses based on
various S objects, including scalar correlations, covariance matrices
<code>arima</code>, <code>lm</code>, and <code>nls</code> fits:  see <code>ellipse</code>.
