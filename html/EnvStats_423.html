<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>predIntLnormSimultaneous</code> returns a simultaneous prediction
interval as well as estimates of the meanlog and sdlog parameters.
The function <code>predIntLnormAltSimultaneous</code> returns a prediction interval as
well as estimates of the mean and coefficient of variation.
</p>
<p>A simultaneous prediction interval for a lognormal distribution is constructed by
taking the natural logarithm of the observations and constructing a prediction
interval based on the normal (Gaussian) distribution by calling
<code>predIntNormSimultaneous</code>.
These prediction limits are then exponentiated to produce a prediction interval on
the original scale of the data.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>x</code> is a numeric vector, <code>predIntLnormSimultaneous</code> returns a list of
class <code>"estimate"</code> containing the estimated parameters, the prediction interval,
and other information.  See the help file for <br><code>estimate.object</code> for details.
</p>
<p>If <code>x</code> is the result of calling an estimation function,
<code>predIntLnormSimultaneous</code> returns a list whose class is the same as <code>x</code>.
The list contains the same components as <code>x</code>, as well as a component called
<code>interval</code> containing the prediction interval information.
If <code>x</code> already has a component called <code>interval</code>, this component is
replaced with the prediction interval information.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><em>Motivation</em> <br>
Prediction and tolerance intervals have long been applied to quality control and
life testing problems (Hahn, 1970b,c; Hahn and Nelson, 1973).  In the context of
environmental statistics, prediction intervals are useful for analyzing data from
groundwater detection monitoring programs at hazardous and solid waste facilities.
</p>
<p>One of the main statistical problems that plague groundwater monitoring programs at
hazardous and solid waste facilities is the requirement of testing several wells and
several constituents at each well on each sampling occasion.  This is an obvious
multiple comparisons problem, and the naive approach of using a standard t-test at
a conventional <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>-level (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) for each test leads to a
very high probability of at least one significant result on each sampling occasion,
when in fact no contamination has occurred.  This problem was pointed out years ago
by Millard (1987) and others.
</p>
<p>Davis and McNichols (1987) proposed simultaneous prediction intervals as a way of
controlling the facility-wide false positive rate (FWFPR) while maintaining adequate
power to detect contamination in the groundwater.  Because of the ubiquitous presence
of spatial variability, it is usually best to use simultaneous prediction intervals
at each well (Davis, 1998a).  That is, by constructing prediction intervals based on
background (pre-landfill) data on each well, and comparing future observations at a
well to the prediction interval for that particular well.  In each of these cases,
the individual <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>-level at each well is equal to the FWFRP divided by the
product of the number of wells and constituents.
</p>
<p>Often, observations at downgradient wells are not available prior to the
construction and operation of the landfill.  In this case, upgradient well data can
be combined to create a background prediction interval, and observations at each
downgradient well can be compared to this prediction interval.  If spatial
variability is present and a major source of variation, however, this method is not
really valid (Davis, 1994; Davis, 1998a).
</p>
<p>Chapter 19 of USEPA (2009) contains an extensive discussion of using the
<code class="reqn">1</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule and the Modified California rule.
</p>
<p>Chapters 1 and 3 of Gibbons et al. (2009) discuss simultaneous prediction intervals
for the normal and lognormal distributions, respectively.
<br></p>
<p><em>The k-of-m Rule</em> <br>
For the <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule, Davis and McNichols (1987) give tables with
“optimal” choices of <code class="reqn">k</code> (in terms of best power for a given overall
confidence level) for selected values of <code class="reqn">m</code>, <code class="reqn">r</code>, and <code class="reqn">n</code>.  They found
that the optimal ratios of <code class="reqn">k</code> to <code class="reqn">m</code> (i.e., <code class="reqn">k/m</code>) are generally small,
in the range of 15-50%.
<br></p>
<p><em>The California Rule</em> <br>
The California rule was mandated in that state for groundwater monitoring at waste
disposal facilities when resampling verification is part of the statistical program
(Barclay's Code of California Regulations, 1991).  The California code mandates a
“California” rule with <code class="reqn">m \ge 3</code>.  The motivation for this rule may have
been a desire to have a majority of the observations in bounds (Davis, 1998a).  For
example, for a <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule with <code class="reqn">k=1</code> and <code class="reqn">m=3</code>, a monitoring
location will pass if the first observation is out of bounds, the second resample
is out of bounds, but the last resample is in bounds, so that 2 out of 3 observations
are out of bounds.  For the California rule with <code class="reqn">m=3</code>, either the first
observation must be in bounds, or the next 2 observations must be in bounds in order
for the monitoring location to pass.
</p>
<p>Davis (1998a) states that if the FWFPR is kept constant, then the California rule
offers little increased power compared to the <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule, and can
actually decrease the power of detecting contamination.
<br></p>
<p><em>The Modified California Rule</em> <br>
The Modified California Rule was proposed as a compromise between a 1-of-<code class="reqn">m</code>
rule and the California rule.  For a given FWFPR, the Modified California rule
achieves better power than the California rule, and still requires at least as many
observations in bounds as out of bounds, unlike a 1-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule.
<br></p>
<p><em>Different Notations Between Different References</em> <br>
For the <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule described in this help file, both
Davis and McNichols (1987) and USEPA (2009, Chapter 19) use the variable
<code class="reqn">p</code> instead of <code class="reqn">k</code> to represent the minimum number
of future observations the interval should contain on each of the <code class="reqn">r</code> sampling
occasions.
</p>
<p>Gibbons et al. (2009, Chapter 1) presents extensive lists of the value of
<code class="reqn">K</code> for both <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rules and California rules.  Gibbons et al.'s
notation reverses the meaning of <code class="reqn">k</code> and <code class="reqn">r</code> compared to the notation used
in this help file.  That is, in Gibbons et al.'s notation, <code class="reqn">k</code> represents the
number of future sampling occasions or monitoring wells, and <code class="reqn">r</code> represents the
minimum number of observations the interval should contain on each sampling occasion.

  # Example 19-1 of USEPA (2009, p. 19-17) shows how to compute an
  # upper simultaneous prediction limit for the 1-of-3 rule for
  # r = 2 future sampling occasions.  The data for this example are

  # We will pool data from 4 background wells that were sampled on
  # a number of different occasions, giving us a sample size of
  # n = 25 to use to construct the prediction limit.

  # There are 50 compliance wells and we will monitor 10 different
  # constituents at each well at each of the r=2 future sampling
  # occasions.  To determine the confidence level we require for
  # the simultaneous prediction interval, USEPA (2009) recommends
  # setting the individual Type I Error level at each well to

  # 1 - (1 - SWFPR)^(1 / (Number of Constituents * Number of Wells))

  # which translates to setting the confidence limit to

  # (1 - SWFPR)^(1 / (Number of Constituents * Number of Wells))

  # where SWFPR = site-wide false positive rate.  For this example, we
