<h2>PROBABILITY OF A VIRTUAL SPECIES</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Probability of a virtual species in France.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(VirtualSpecies)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The 3 bioclimatic variables of WorldClim at a resolution of five arc-minutes (Hijmans et al., 2005) BIO8 (Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter), BIO12 (Annual Precipitation) and BIO15 (Precipitation Seasonality, Coefficient of Variation) were used to generate the distribution of the virtual species by using the virtualspecies R package (Leroy et al. 2016; 2018). The limits were from -5ยบ to 6ยบ in latitude, and from 44ยบ to 49ยบ. Subsequently, 50% of the data were randomly selected, in order to simulate a random sampling of the species. The final continuous suitability maps obtained in this way were scaled between 0 and 1.
