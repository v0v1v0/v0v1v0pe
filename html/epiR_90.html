Surveillance system specificity assuming representative sampling
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates surveillance system (population level) specificity assuming representative sampling and imperfect test specificity.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rsu.spp.rs(N, n, c = 1, sp.u)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar or vector of the same length as that vector of <code>n</code> defining the [cluster] population size. Use <code>NA</code> if the size of the population not known, or for a more general application see details, below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar or vector defining the sample size.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>c</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar or vector of the same length as that vector of <code>n</code> defining the cut-point number of positives to classify a cluster as positive, if the number of positive samples is less than <code>c</code> the cluster is declared is negative, if the number of positive samples is greater than <code>c</code> the cluster is declared positive.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sp.u</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar (0 to 1) or vector of same length as <code>n</code>, the specificity of the diagnostic test at the surveillance unit level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates population specificity using the hypergeometric distribution if <code>N</code> and <code>c</code> are provided and the binomial distribution otherwise.
</p>
<p>If <code>N</code> is provided the number of false positives is fixed, based on <code>N</code> and test specificity <code>sp.u</code>. This implies that test specificity is a fixed individual-level characteristic (e.g., due to specific cross-reacting infection). If <code>N</code> is not supplied, cluster (e.g., herd) specificity is a random binomial function based only on the number of samples and test specificity (i.e., specificity is a function of the test and independent of individual characteristics).  
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of population specificity estimates.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1:
## Calculate the surveillance system specificity (i.e., the probability that 
## an uninfected population will be correctly identified as negative) if 30 
## surveillance units have been tested from a population of 150 using a 
## diagnostic test with surveillance unit specificity of 0.90, using a 
## cut-point of one or more positives to consider the population positive.

## A specificity of 0.90 means that 9 out of 10 samples from disease-negative
## surveillance units will return a negative result (i.e., one of them will be
## a false positive).
 
rsu.spp.rs(N = 150, n = 30, c = 1, sp.u = 0.90)

## The surveillance system specificity is 0.03. There is a probability of 
## 0.03 that all 30 samples will be negative.   


## EXAMPLE 2:
## Now assume we set a cut-point of 6. That is, 6 or more samples have to 
## return a positive result for us to declare the population positive:

rsu.spp.rs(N = 150, n = 30, c = 6, sp.u = 0.90)

## The surveillance system specificity is 0.95.
