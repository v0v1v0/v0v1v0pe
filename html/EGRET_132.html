<h2>Creates a character variable that describes the period of analysis, when the period of analysis is being set by the user and not from AnnualResults</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The period of analysis can be of any length from 1 month to 12 months. 
The period of analysis can have any starting month from 1 (January) through 12 (December). 
This function produces a character that describes this period of analysis. 
For example "water year", "calendar year", "year starting with April", or 
"Season consisting of April, May, June". 
There is an alternative version of this function for the case where AnnualResults exists. 
And we want to use the period of analysis defined there. 
That function is called setSeasonLabel.
