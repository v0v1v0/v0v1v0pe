<h2>Variable importance for GLMs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the relative importance of predictor variables based on the
concept of explained deviance. This is achieved by fitting a GLMs multiple
times, each time leaving out a different predictor variable to observe its
impact on the model's performance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">var_importance(fitted, modelID = NULL, data = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fitted</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>glm</code>, a list of GLMs obtained using the
function <code>fit_glms</code>, or an object <code>enmpa_fitted_models</code> from
<code>fit_selected</code> .</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>modelID</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) vector of ModelID(s) to be considered when the
<code>fitted</code> input is of the class <code>enmpa_fitted_models</code>. By default all models
are included. Default = NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame or matrix of data used in the model calibration step.
It must be defined in case the model entered does not explicitly include a
data component. Default = NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The process begins by fitting the full GLM model, which includes all predictor
variables. Subsequently, separate GLM models are fitted, excluding one
variable at a time to assess the influence of its absence on the model's
performance. By systematically evaluating the effect of removing each
predictor variable, the function provides valuable insights into their
individual contributions to the model's overall performance and explanatory
power.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame containing the relative contribution of each variable. An
identification for distinct models is added if <code>fitted</code> contains multiple
models.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Load a fitted selected model
data(sel_fit, package = "enmpa")

# Variable importance for single models
var_importance(sel_fit, modelID = "ModelID_7")

# Variable importance for multiple models (only one model in this list)
var_importance(sel_fit)
</code></pre>
