<h2>Fit time-to-dropout model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits a specified time-to-dropout model to the dropout data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fitDropout(
  df,
  dropout_model = "exponential",
  piecewiseDropoutTime = 0,
  by_treatment = FALSE,
  criterion = "both"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>The subject-level dropout data, including <code>time</code> and
<code>dropout</code>. The data should also include <code>treatment</code>
coded as 1, 2, and so on, and <code>treatment_description</code>
for fitting the dropout model by treatment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dropout_model</code></td>
<td>
<p>The dropout model used to analyze the dropout data
which can be set to one of the following options: "exponential",
"Weibull", "log-logistic", "log-normal", or "piecewise exponential".
By default, it is set to "exponential".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>piecewiseDropoutTime</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector that specifies the time
intervals for the piecewise exponential dropout distribution.
Must start with 0, e.g., c(0, 60) breaks the time axis into 2
event intervals: [0, 60) and [60, Inf). By default, it is set to 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by_treatment</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Boolean variable to control whether or not to
fit the time-to-dropout data by treatment group. By default,
it is set to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>criterion</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character variable to denote the criterion in model
selection to shown in the figure, which can be set to one of the following
options: "aic","bic" or "both". By default,it is set to <code>both</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of results from the model fit including key information
such as the dropout model, <code>model</code>, the estimated model parameters,
<code>theta</code>, the covariance matrix, <code>vtheta</code>, as well as the
Bayesian Information Criterion, <code>bic</code>, and Akaike Information Criterion, <code>aic</code>.
</p>
<p>If the piecewise exponential model is used, the location
of knots used in the model, <code>piecewiseDropoutTime</code>, will
be included in the list of results.
</p>
<p>When fitting the dropout model by treatment, the outcome is presented
as a list of lists, where each list element corresponds to a
specific treatment group.
</p>
<p>The fitted time-to-dropout survival curve is also returned.
