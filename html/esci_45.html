<h2>SelfExplain - Ch15 - from McEldoon et al. (2013)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Self-explaining is a learning strategy where students write or say their own
explanations of the material they are studying. Self-explaining has generally
been found to be more effective than standard studying, but it may also take
more time. This raises the question of whether it's the study strategy or the
extra time that benefits learning. To explore this issue, grade school
children took a pretest of mathematics conceptual knowledge, studied
mathematics problems, and then took a similar posttest (McEldoon et al.,
2013). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two study conditions:
normal study + more practice (More Practice group), or self-explaining
(Self-Explain group). The first condition was intended to make time spent
learning to be similar for the two groups. You can find part of the data from
this study in SelfExplain, the scores being percent correct.
