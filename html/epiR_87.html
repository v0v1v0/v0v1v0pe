<h2>
Surveillance system sensitivity by combining multiple surveillance components
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates surveillance system (population-level) sensitivity for multiple components, accounting for lack of independence (overlap) between components.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rsu.sep.rsmult(C = NA, pstar.c, rr, ppr, se.c)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar integer or vector of the same length as <code>rr</code>, representing the population sizes (number of clusters) for each risk group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pstar.c</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar (0 to 1) representing the cluster level design prevalence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rr</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of length equal to the number of risk strata, representing the cluster relative risks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ppr</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of the same length as <code>rr</code> representing the cluster level population proportions. Ignored if <code>C</code> is specified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se.c</code></td>
<td>
<p>surveillance system sensitivity estimates for clusters in each component and corresponding risk group. A list with multiple elements where each element is a dataframe of population sensitivity values from a separate surveillance system component. The first column equals the clusterid, the second column equals the cluster-level risk group index and the third column equals the population sensitivity values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list comprised of two elements:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se.p</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix (or vector if <code>C</code> is not specified) of population-level (surveillance system) sensitivities (binomial and hypergeometric and adjusted vs unadjusted).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se.component</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of adjusted and unadjusted sensitivities for each component.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1:
## You are working with a population that is comprised of indviduals in 
## 'high' and 'low' risk area. There are 300 individuals in the high risk  
## area and 1200 individuals in the low risk area. The risk of disease for 
## those in the high risk area is assumed to be three times that of the low
## risk area.

C &lt;- c(300,1200)
pstar.c &lt;- 0.01
rr &lt;- c(3,1)

## Generate population sensitivity values for clusters in each component of
## the surveillance system. Each of the three dataframes below lists id, 
## rg (risk group) and cse (component sensitivity):

comp1 &lt;- data.frame(id = 1:100, 
   rg = c(rep(1,time = 50), rep(2, times = 50)), 
   cse = rep(0.5, times = 100)) 

comp2 &lt;- data.frame(id = seq(from = 2, to = 120, by = 2), 
   rg = c(rep(1, times = 25), rep(2, times = 35)), 
   cse = runif(n = 60, min = 0.5, max = 0.8))

comp3 &lt;- data.frame(id = seq(from = 5, to = 120, by = 5), 
   rg = c(rep(1, times = 10), rep(2, times = 14)), 
   cse = runif(n = 24, min = 0.7, max = 1))
 
# Combine the three components into a list:  
se.c &lt;- list(comp1, comp2, comp3)

## What is the overall population-level (surveillance system) sensitivity?

rsu.sep.rsmult(C = C, pstar.c = pstar.c, rr = rr, ppr = NA, se.c = se.c)

## The overall adjusted system sensitivity (calculated using the binomial
## distribution) is 0.85.  


## EXAMPLE 2:
## Assume that you don't know exactly how many individuals are in the high 
## and low risk areas but you have a rough estimate that the proportion of
## the population in each area is 0.2 and 0.8, respectively. What is the 
## population-level (surveillance system) sensitivity?

ppr &lt;- c(0.20,0.80)

rsu.sep.rsmult(C = NA, pstar.c = pstar.c, rr = rr, ppr = ppr, se.c = se.c)

## The overall adjusted system sensitivity (calculated using the binomial
## distribution) is 0.85.
