<h2>Invertebrate abundances in a revegetation study</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a study looking at the effect of revegetation on invertebrate communities 
(data from Anthony Pik, Macquarie University). Invertebrates were sampled in 4-5 pitfall
traps at eight sites that had undergone revegetation, and two sites that hadn't, and it
was of interest to see what the effect of revegetation was on the invertebrate community.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(reveg)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing three objects:</p>

<dl>
<dt>abund</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data frame with abundances of 24 Orders of invertebrate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pitfalls</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector specifying the number of pitfall traps that were collected at each site.</p>
</dd>
<dt>treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether the site was a 'Control' or a site that had undergone revegetation ('Impact').</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(reveg)
worms = reveg$abund$Haplotaxida
plot(worms~treatment, data=reveg, horizontal=TRUE,
  las=1, xlab="",ylab="Worm abundance")
