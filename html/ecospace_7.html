<h2>Use Neutral Rule to Simulate Ecological Diversification of a Biota.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implement Monte Carlo simulation of a biota undergoing ecological
diversification using the neutral rule. Can be used as a simple permutation
test (draw species at random with replacement from provided species pool) if
set <code>Sseed</code> equal to <code>Smax</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">neutral(nreps = 1, Sseed, Smax, ecospace)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nreps</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of integers (such as a sequence) specifying sample number
produced. Only used when function is applied within <code>lapply</code> or
related function. Default <code>nreps = 1</code> or any other integer produces a
single sample.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sseed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer giving number of species (or other taxa) to use at start
of simulation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Smax</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum number of species (or other taxa) to include in
simulation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ecospace</code></td>
<td>
<p>An ecospace framework (functional trait space) of class
<code>ecospace</code>.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Simulations are implemented as Monte Carlo processes in which
species are added iteratively to assemblages, with all added species having
their character states specified by the model rules, here the 'neutral'
rule. Simulations begin with the seeding of <code>Sseed</code> number of species,
chosen at random (with replacement) from either the species pool (if
provided in the <code>weight.file</code> when building the ecospace framework
using <code>create_ecospace</code>) or following the neutral-rule algorithm (if a
pool is not provided). Once seeded, the simulations proceed iteratively
(character-by-character, species-by-species) by following the appropriate
algorithm, as explained below, until terminated at <code>Smax</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Neutral rule algorithm:</strong> Choose remaining species (or seed species,
if no pool) as random multinomial draws from theoretical ecospace framework
(using whatever constraints and structure was provided by the ecospace
framework in <code>create_ecospace</code>). Thus, if relative weighting was
provided to character states (functional traits), simulated species will
mimic these weights, on average. If state combinations were constrained (by
setting <code>constraint</code> in <code>create_ecospace</code>), then unallowed state
combinations will not be allowed in simulated species.
</p>
<p>Note that this simulation is not a simple permutation test of a species
pool (if provided). The life habit of each new species is built
character-by-character from the realm of theoretically possible states
allowed by the ecospace framework. Simulated species can occupy
combinations of character states that did not occur in the species pool (if
provided). This is an important feature of the simulations, allowing the
entire theoretical ecospace to be explored by the neutral model. However,
the simulation can be used as a simple permutation test (draw species at
random with replacement from provided species pool) if set <code>Sseed</code>
equal to <code>Smax</code> and a species pool is supplied when building the
ecospace framework.
</p>
<p>This rule has also been termed the diffusional, null, and passive model
(Bush and Novack-Gottshall 2012). Additional details on the neutral
simulation are provided in Novack-Gottshall (2016a,b), including
sensitivity to ecospace framework (functional trait space) structure,
recommendations for model selection, and basis in ecological and
evolutionary theory.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame with <code>Smax</code> rows (representing species) and
as many columns as specified by number of characters/states (functional
traits) in the ecospace framework. Columns will have the same data type
(numeric, factor, ordered numeric, or ordered factor) as specified in the
ecospace framework.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The function has been written to allow usage (using
<code>lapply</code> or some other list-apply function) in 'embarrassingly
parallel' implementations in a high-performance computing environment.
