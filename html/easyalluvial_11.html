<h2>get predictions compatible with the partial dependence plotting method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Alluvial plots are capable of displaying higher dimensional data
on a plane, thus lend themselves to plot the response of a statistical model
to changes in the input data across multiple dimensions. The practical limit
here is 4 dimensions while conventional partial dependence plots are limited
to 2 dimensions.
</p>
<p>Briefly the 4 variables with the highest feature importance for a given
model are selected and 5 values spread over the variable range are selected
for each. Then a grid of all possible combinations is created. All
none-plotted variables are set to the values found in the first row of the
training data set. Using this artificial data space model predictions are
being generated. This process is then repeated for each row in the training
data set and the overall model response is averaged in the end. Each of the
possible combinations is plotted as a flow which is coloured by the bin
corresponding to the average model response generated by that particular
combination.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_pdp_predictions(
  df,
  imp,
  m,
  degree = 4,
  bins = 5,
  .f_predict = predict,
  parallel = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>dataframe, training data</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>imp</code></td>
<td>
<p>dataframe, with not more then two columns one of them numeric
containing importance measures and one character or factor column containing
corresponding variable names as found in training data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>model object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>degree</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer,  number of top important variables to select. For
plotting more than 4 will result in two many flows and the alluvial plot
will not be very readable, Default: 4</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bins</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer, number of bins for numeric variables, increasing this
number might result in too many flows, Default: 5</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.f_predict</code></td>
<td>
<p>corresponding model predict() function. Needs to accept 'm'
as the first parameter and use the 'newdata' parameter. Supply a wrapper for
predict functions with x-y syntax. For parallel processing the predict
method of object classes will not always get imported correctly to the worker
environment. We can pass the correct predict method via this parameter for 
example randomForest:::predict.randomForest. Note that a lot of modeling
packages do not export the predict method explicitly and it can only be found
using :::.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, turn on parallel processing. Default: FALSE</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>vector, predictions
</p>


<h3>Parallel Processing</h3>

<p>We are using 'furrr' and the 'future' package to paralelize some of the
computational steps for calculating the predictions. It is up to the user
to register a compatible backend (see plan).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> df = mtcars2[, ! names(mtcars2) %in% 'ids' ]
 m = randomForest::randomForest( disp ~ ., df)
 imp = m$importance

 pred = get_pdp_predictions(df, imp
                            , m
                            , degree = 3
                            , bins = 5)

# parallel processing --------------------------
## Not run: 
 future::plan("multisession")
 
 # note that we have to pass the predict method via .f_predict otherwise
 # it will not be available in the worker's environment.
 
 pred = get_pdp_predictions(df, imp
                            , m
                            , degree = 3
                            , bins = 5,
                            , parallel = TRUE
                            , .f_predict = randomForest:::predict.randomForest)
