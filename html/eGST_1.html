<h2>eGST (eQTL-based Genetic Sub-Typer): Leveraging eQTLs to identify
individual-level tissue of interest for a complex trait.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Genetic predisposition for complex traits is often manifested through multiple tissues
of interest at different time points in the development. As an example, the genetic predisposition
for obesity could be manifested through inherited variants that control metabolism through regulation
of genes expressed in the brain and/or through the control of fat storage in the adipose tissue by
dysregulation of genes expressed in adipose tissue. We present a method eGST that integrates
tissue-specific eQTLs with GWAS data for a complex trait to probabilistically assign a
tissue of interest to the phenotype of each individual in the study. eGST estimates
the posterior probability that an individual's phenotype can be assigned to a
tissue based on individual-level genotype data of tissue-specific eQTLs and marginal
phenotype data in a GWAS cohort. Under a Bayesian framework of mixture model,
eGST employs a maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm
to estimate the tissue-specific posterior probability across individuals.

<h3>Functions</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>eGST</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It estimates the posterior probability that the genetic susceptibility
of the phenotype of an individual in the study is mediated through eQTLs specific to a tissue
of interest. The phenotype across individuals can be classified into tissues under consideration
based on the estimated tissue-specific posterior probability across individuals.</p>
