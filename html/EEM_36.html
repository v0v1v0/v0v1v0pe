<h2>Gluten</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Pure wheat gluten and pure wheat starch were mixed at gluten ratios ranging from 0 to 100 %, in 20 % increments. The samples were set in a cell with a quartz glass window, and the samples were pressed against the glass to obtain a flat surface. This dataset contains fluorescence excitation-emission profiles of each samples with 8 replicates. To save space, only the data with gluten ratios ranging from 0 to 60 % was provided.
