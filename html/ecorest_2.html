<h2>Identifies "best buy" actions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>BBfinder</code> this analysis examines the slope of the cost-effectiveness frontier to
isolate how unit cost (cost/benefit) increases with increasing environmental benefit.
Restoration actions with the lowest slope of unit cost are considered "best buys".
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">BBfinder(benefit, cost, CE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>benefit</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of restoration benefits. Typically, these are time-averaged
ecological outcomes (e.g., average annual habitat units). Often project benefits
are best presented as the "lift" associated with a restoration action
(i.e., the benefits of an alternative minus the benefits of a "no action" plan).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cost</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of restoration costs. Typically, these are monetary costs
associated with a given restoration action such as project first cost or
annualized economic cost. Notably, these functions are agnostic to units, so costs
could also be non-monetary such as lost political capital or social costs
of each alternative.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CE</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of 0's and 1's indicating whether a plan is cost-effective (1)
or non-cost-effective (0). Can be derived from ecorest::CEfinder.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with summaries of all restoration actions as well as best buy plans only.
