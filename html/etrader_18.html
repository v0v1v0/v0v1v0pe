<p>ETRADE offers a sandbox environment for validating API calls
and responses. If using the sandbox environment, this must be set to TRUE
in each function called throughout etrader. ETRADE states "Sandbox
responses use stored data that's intended to provide typical responses for
basic use cases. So the responses you receive will not contain current
data, and may not exactly match your requests in other ways." Essentially,
the responses will not match the requests entered but successful pull will
indicate whether the entry was valid or not.</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>TRADES THAT ARE SUCCESSFULLY ENTERED WILL BE SENT FOR
EXECUTION. THIS FUNCTION HAS HUNDREDS OF POTENTIAL COMBINATIONS AND ONLY A
HANDFUL HAVE BEEN TESTED. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO TEST THE DESIRED
ORDER USING THE SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT. PLEASE NOTE THE SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT
WILL NOT RETURN THE ORDER ENTERED, IT IS USED FOR CONFIRMING THE ORDER
ENTRY HAS CORRECT SYNTAX. ORDERS CAN ALSO BE TESTED IN OFF MARKET HOURS ON
A VERY SMALL QUANTITY WITH LITTLE MONEY AT STAKE. ETRADE HAS THEIR OWN
ERROR HANDLING BUT IF A SUCCESSFUL COMBINATION IS ENTERED IT COULD BE
EXECUTED UNINTENTIONALLY. DOUBLE CHECK ALL ENTRIES BEFORE SUBMITTING.
