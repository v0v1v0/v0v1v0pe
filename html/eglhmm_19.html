<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data sets from the book
“An Introduction to Discrete-Valued Time Series” by
Christian H. Weiß.

</p>
<p>The data sets are named <code>Bovine</code>, <code>Cryptosporidiosis</code>,
<code>Downloads</code>, <code>EricssonB_Jul2</code>, <code>FattyLiver</code>,
<code>FattyLiver2</code>, <code>goldparticle380</code>,
<code>Hanta</code>, <code>InfantEEGsleepstates</code>, <code>IPs</code>,
<code>LegionnairesDisease</code>, <code>OffshoreRigcountsAlaska</code>,
<code>PriceStability</code>, <code>Strikes</code> and <code>WoodPeweeSong</code>.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Each data set is a data frame with a single column named <code>"y"</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Bovine</code>
There are 8419 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a factor,
with levels <code>"a","c","g","t"</code>, the DNA “bases”.
It constitutes the DNA sequence of the bovine leukemia virus.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Cryptosporidiosis</code>
There are 365 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector.  It consists of weekly counts of new infections, in Germany
in the years 2002 to 2008.  The counts vary between 2 and 78.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Downloads</code>
There are 267 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric
(integer) vector.  It consists of the daily number of downloads
of a TEX editor for the period from June 2006 to February 2007.
These counts vary between 0 and 14.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>EricssonB_Jul2</code>
There are 460 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector.  It consists of the number of transactions per minute,
of the Ericsson B stock, between 9:35 and 17:14 on 2 July, 2002.
The counts vary between 0 and 37.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>FattyLiver</code>
There are 928 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (binary)
vector.  The value 1 indicates that “the considered
diagnosis cannot be excluded for the current patient; that is,
suitable countermeasures are required”, and the value 0 indicates
that this is not so.  The values refer to different patients,
examined sequentially over time.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>FattyLiver2</code>
There are 449 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (binary)
vector as for <code>FattyLiver</code>.  (Different examiner, different
sequence of patients.)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>goldparticle380</code>
There are 380 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector of counts of gold particles measured in a fixed volume
element of a colloidal solution over time. The count values
vary because of the Brownian motion of the particles.  They vary
between 0 and 7.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Hanta</code>
There are 52 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector consisting of the weekly number of territorial units (out of <code class="reqn">n = 38</code>
territorial units with at least one new case of a hantavirus infections,
in the year 2011.  The numbers vary between 0 and 11. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>InfantEEGsleepstates</code>
There are 107 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a factor with
levels <code>qt, qh, tr, al, ah, aw</code>.  The level <code>"aw"</code>
does not actually appear.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>IPs</code>
There are 241 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector of the counts of different IP addresses registered at a
web server within periods of length two minutes, “assumed”
to have been observed between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on 29
November 2005.  The counts vary between 0 and 8.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>LegionnairesDisease</code>
There are 365 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector of weekly counts of new infections in Germany, in the
years 2002 to 2008.  The counts vary between 0 and 26.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>OffshoreRigcountsAlaska</code>
There are 417 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector of weekly counts of active rotary drilling rigs in Alaska
for the period 1990 to 1997. The counts vary between 0 and 6.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>PriceStability</code>
There are 152 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector of monthly counts of countries (out of a group of 17
countries) that showed stable prices (that is, an inflation rate
below 2%), in the period from January 2000 to December 2006.
The counts vary between 0 and 17.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Strikes</code>
There are 108 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a numeric (integer)
vector of the monthly counts of work stoppages (strikes and
lock-outs) of 1000 or more workers in the period 1994 to 2002.
The counts vary between 0 and 14.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>WoodPeweeSong</code>
There are 1327 rows.  The column <code>"y"</code> is a factor with
levels <code>"1", "2", "3"</code> corresponding to the three different
“phrases” of wood wewee song.  The time series comprises
a sequence of observations of the “morning twilight”
song of the wood pewee.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For detailed information about each of these data sets, see the
book cited in the <b>References</b>.
</p>
<p>Note that the data sets <code>Cryptosporidiosis</code>
and <code>LegionnairesDisease</code> are actually
called <br><code>Cryptosporidiosis_02-08</code> and
<code>LegionnairesDisease_02-08</code> in the given reference.
The <br> “suffixes” were removed since the minus sign causes
problems in a variable name in <code>R</code>.
