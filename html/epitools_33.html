<h2>Outbreak of Gastrointestinal Illness in Oswego County, 1940</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>On April 19, 1940, the local health officer in the village of
Lycoming, Oswego County, New York, reported the occurrence of an
outbreak of acute gastrointestinal illness to the District Health
Officer in Syracuse. Dr. A. M. Rubin, epidemiologist-in-training, was
assigned to conduct an investigation. 
</p>
<p>When Dr. Rubin arrived in the field, he learned from the health
officer that all persons known to be ill had attended a church supper
held on the previous evening, April 18. Family members who did not
attend the church supper did not become ill. Accordingly, Dr. Rubin
focused the investigation on the supper. He completed Interviews with
75 of the 80 persons known to have attended, collecting information
about the occurrence and time of onset of symptoms, and foods
consumed. Of the 75 persons interviewed, 46 persons reported
gastrointestinal illness.
</p>
<p>The onset of illness in all cases was acute, characterized chiefly by
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. None of the ill
persons reported having an elevated temperature; all recovered within
24 to 30 hours. Approximately 20
physicians. No fecal specimens were obtained for bacteriologic
examination.
</p>
<p>The supper was held in the basement of the village church. Foods were
contributed by numerous members of the congregation. The supper began
at 6:00 p.m. and continued until 11:00 p.m. Food was spread out on a
table and consumed over a period of several hours. Data regarding
onset of illness and food eaten or water drunk by each of the 75
persons interviewed are provided in the attached line listing (Oswego
dataset). The approximate time of eating supper was collected for only
about half the persons who had gastrointestinal illness.
