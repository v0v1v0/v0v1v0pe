<h2>Kardas Expt 3 - Ch07 - from Kardas and O'Brien (2018), Experiment 3</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to change the battery in your phone, cook the perfect
souffle, or perform a three-ball juggle. Just as numerous people do every
day, you might search online to find a video that shows what to do. Suppose
you watch such a video just once. First question: How well would you then
predict you could perform the task? Second question: How well would you
actually perform the task, the first time you tried? Now suppose you watch
the video many times: Again consider the two questions. These questions were
investigated in a series of studies by Kardas and O'Brien (2018). Let's first
do some quick analyses of Kardas Experiments 3 and 4-let's call them Expt 3
and Expt 4-focusing on the effect of watching a video many times rather than
once. In Expt 3, participants first watched a brief video of a person
performing the moonwalk. The Low Exposure group watched the video once, the
High Exposure group 20 times. Then participants predicted, on a 1 to 10
scale, how well they felt they would be able to perform the moonwalk
themselves. Finally, they attempted a single performance of the moonwalk,
which was videoed. These videos were rated, on the same 1 to 10 scale, by
independent raters.
