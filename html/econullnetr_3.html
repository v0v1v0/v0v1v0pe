<h2>'Forbidden' links to accompany the <code>Broadstone</code> data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Networks often contain 'forbidden links', where interactions are not possible
between two taxa due to factors such as large differences in body size,
spatio-temporal mismatches or specialised flower morphology in flower visitation
networks.  <code>Broadstone.fl</code> summarises the forbidden links in the
<code>Broadstone</code> food web, estimated from the interactions observed
from a complete year's sampling (Table 3 in Woodward <em>et al</em>. 2005). This
table is illustrative, and should not be considered a definitive list.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Broadstone.fl
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 columns and seven rows, one row for each of the
seven predator taxa.  The first column (<code>Predator</code>) lists the seven taxa,
whilst the remaining 19 columns are the invertebrate taxa in the food web:
each element indicates whether the predator can consume that taxon (1) or
whether the link is 'forbidden' (0).
