<h2>Cumulative distribution function of time of schooling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>edcdf</code> is a function to graph the CDF of time of schooling for any group of
countries using the set of estimates developed in Jorda and Alonso (2017).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">edcdf(countries, init.y, final.y, database)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>character vector with the country codes of the countries
to be used. Some macro-regions are already defined and can be used
instead of the country codes: <code>South Asia, Europe and Central Asia,
Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Advanced
Economies, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific</code>.
(see <code>data_country</code>).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We use the set of estimates developed in Jorda and Alonso (2017), where
the generalized gamma distribution (Stacy, 1962) is used to model the time that
individuals attend school until they complete the educational cycle or decide to
drop out. The reason is twofold; first, the generalized gamma distribution is a
parsimonious model that nests most of the parametric assumptions described in the
literature (see, Marshall and Olkin, 2007). Second, the generalized gamma distribution
is able to model one- and zero-mode distributions and to represent several types of
hazard rates.The flexibility of this model to consider such heterogeneity, makes it
an outstanding candidate to model the distribution of education. It is important to
highlight that this parametric model includes as particular cases most of the
distributions commonly used in survival analysis, including the Weibull, the
exponential, and the gamma distributions, so it would converge to any of its special
cases if needed.
</p>
<p>To accommodate time and country varying parameters, the distribution of education
of each country and year is estimated by non-linear least squares (see, Jorda and
Alonso (2017) for further description on the estimation strategy).The distribution
of education of a particular group or region of countries is simply defined as a
mixture of the national distributions, weighted by their population shares.
