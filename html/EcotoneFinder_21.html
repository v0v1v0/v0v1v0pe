<h2>Networkeco for data series</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Networkeco for data series
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NetworkEcoSeries(ecotonefinder, threshold = 0.8, method = c("cmeans",
  "vegclust"), plot.type = c("percentage", "heatmap", "corrplot",
  "network"), plot = c("species", "community"), no.plot = FALSE,
  order.sp = NULL, dist.method = "inner_product", dist = c("count",
  "relative", "raw"), network.group = c("site", "cluster"),
  method.corr = "number", ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ecotonefinder</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing elements named in the same way than
EcotoneFinderSeries function outcomes. Must contain cmeans results or
vegclust results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>If dist = "count", the membership grade threshold used to
sort the species in the different clusters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The membership computation method to be used. Must be present
in the ecotonefinder list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which graphical representation to be plotted. Among
"percentage", "corrplot", "heatmap","network"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>If plot = "species", the distances are computed between the
species in the data. If plot = "community", the distances are computed
between the cluster centroids.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>no.plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should the plot be displayed?. Set to TRUE to gain
computation time with large community matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order.sp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector providing the order in which to arrange the species.
If NULL, the column order will be kept.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance method for the computation of a distance matrix,
when dist = "raw" or dist = "percent".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of data on which distance calculations are made from. If
dist = "raw", the distance matrix is computed from the membership matrix
directly. if dist = "relative", the distance matrix is computed from the
relative memberships grades of each species in the clusters (between 0 and
1). If dist = "count", the species are assigned to clusters according to
the threshold and the distance matrix is computed from the number of common
species between the different clusters. See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>network.group</code></td>
<td>
<p>If network.group = "site" the nodes of the networks will
be colored according to the different times or sites of the series. If
network.group = "cluster" the nodes of the network will be colored
according to the different fuzzy clusters. Can be user defined (see qgraph
documentation for details) but must be a factor of the same lenght as the
nodes of the graph.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method.corr</code></td>
<td>
<p>If plot.type = "corrplot", the method to be used for the
corrplot. Must be one of "circle", "square", "ellipse", "number", "shade",
"color", "pie". Default to "number".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments to be passed to the plotting functions, see
details.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>NetworkEcoSeries is a generalisation of the NetworkEco function to
analyses space/time series. The ... argument may be used to pass additional
arguments to the plotting functions (for graphical purposes).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing the percentage matrix, the distance matrix and the
network object (depending of the arguments passed to the function)
</p>
