<h2>Takes an overlap matrix and a tree and runs permutation tests to
determine the statistical significance of the relationship between
overlap and time</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes an overlap matrix and a tree and runs permutation tests to
determine the statistical significance of the relationship between
overlap and time
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">enmtools.aoc(
  clade,
  env = NULL,
  overlap.source,
  nreps = 100,
  f = NULL,
  overlap.matrix = NULL,
  metric = "D",
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clade</code></td>
<td>
<p>An enmtools.clade object containing species data and a phylogeny</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>env</code></td>
<td>
<p>Environmental layers for use when overlap is calculated using niche models.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap.source</code></td>
<td>
<p>The source of the overlaps to calculate.  Choices are "bc", "dm", "gam", "glm", "mx", "range", and "point"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nreps</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number of reps to do</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>f</code></td>
<td>
<p>The model to be used for GLM and GAM comparisons</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap.matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of overlaps to use, for option overlap.source = "matrix"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>metric</code></td>
<td>
<p>The overlap metric to use. For ENM sources, this can be any combination of "D", "I", "cor", "env.D", "env.I", and "env.cor".
for range and point overlap this argument is ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Arguments to be passed to modeling functions for ENM-based overlaps.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing a data frame of coefficients from the empirical regression of overlap on time along with the coefficients from all Monte Carlo replicates, along with plots and p values for the accompanying statistical tests.
