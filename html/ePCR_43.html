<h2>Scoring function for evaluating survival prediction by time-wise integrated AUC</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Time-wise integrated prediction for survival is performed by this scoring function using the timeROC-package. 
It's offered as an alternative to the score.cindex-function with the difference that time-wise integrated AUC is sensitive to the choice of time-window. 
By default (as similar to DREAM 9.5 mCRPC challenge), the AUCs are determined at 6 to 30 months, and the AUC is then normalized to a score within [0,1]. Notice that for studies shorter or longer than this proposed time window, the scoring function should be adjusted accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">score.iAUC(pred, time, event, real, times = seq(6, 30, by = 1) * 30.5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pred</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric risk score for each event</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of event or censoring times</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>event</code></td>
<td>
<p>A binary valued vector that indicates either death (1) or right-censoring (0)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>real</code></td>
<td>
<p>A previously constructed Surv-object instead of providing time and event</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>times</code></td>
<td>
<p>Time-points at which to evaluate the iAUC</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The integrated area under the ROC-curve over time
</p>
