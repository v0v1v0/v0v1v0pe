<h2>Perceived Health Risk of Drugs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In summer 2007, a survey was conducted at the Department of Psychology,
University of Tuebingen.  Hundred and ninety-two participants were presented
with all 15 unordered pairs of the names of six drugs or substances and
asked to choose the drug they judged as more dangerous for their health.
The six drugs were alcohol (alc), tobacco (tob), cannabis (can), ecstasy
(ecs), heroine (her), and cocaine (coc).  Choice frequencies were aggregated
in four groups defined by gender and age.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(drugrisk)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 3d array consisting of four square matrices of choice
frequencies (row drugs are judged over column drugs):
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>drugrisk[, , group = "female30"]</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>holds the choices
of the 48 female participants up to 30 years of age.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>drugrisk[, , group = "female31"]</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>holds the choices
of the 48 female participants from 31 years of age.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>drugrisk[, , group = "male30"]</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>holds the choices
of the 48 male participants up to 30 years of age.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>drugrisk[, , group = "male31"]</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>holds the choices
of the 48 male participants from 31 years of age.</p>
</dd>
