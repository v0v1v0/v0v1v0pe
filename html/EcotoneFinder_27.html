<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Method to calculate the derivative of irregular functions:
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Slope(ecotonefinder, method = c("dca", "fanny", "vegclust", "cmeans",
  "diversity", "all"), window = 3, axis.number = 1,
  groups = ecotonefinder$groups, diversity = c("shannon", "richness",
  "expShannon", "pielou", "all"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ecotonefinder</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing elements named in the same way than
EcotoneFinder function outcomes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the method for which the slopes should be
calculated. Correspond to the names of the list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window</code></td>
<td>
<p>Must be an odd number. The interval to be used for slope
calculation. The bigger the window, the more averaged the slope will be.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>axis.number</code></td>
<td>
<p>If "dca" is chosen, indicate the number of axis over which
to calculate the slope (first axis, first and second axis,...)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groups</code></td>
<td>
<p>If any clustering method is chosen, corresponds to the index of
the cluster for which the slope shold be calculated. If "all", the slope
will be calculated for all the clusters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>diversity</code></td>
<td>
<p>If "diversity" is chosen in the method argument, define the
diversity index for which to calculate the slope. "all" can be chosen.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Slope calculations are done by moving window analysis. The width of
the windows is defined by the window argument. For each window, the result
of slope coefficient of a linear model (lm function of the stat package) is
stored and used to draw the general slope along the gradient. The bigger the
window, the more points will be used to compute the linear models, meaning
the obtained slopes will be smoother. This also results in the addition of
NAs at the ends of the gradient.
</p>
<p>The first axis of DCA has been used as a beta-diversity index, and its
derivative as a method to locate ecotones (see Brownstein et al., 2013). The
Slope function provide the possibility of computing the slope of the other
axis, to avoid the loss of information induced by the reduction of the
dimentionality of the original data. Similarly, the slopes of the fuzzy
clusters can be used to pinpoint the transitions between them. The value of
the slopes can be an indicator of the relative sharpness of the transion
area. Particularly, as the memberships of the fuzzy clusters range betwwen 0
and 1, these values can readilly be compared between studies and datasets.
These values vary depending on the window width and can be very sensible to
noise in the original data. A reliable method to mathematically identify
breaks is still needed and careful interpretation by the user is still
required.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> #### Artificial dataset:
 SyntheticTrial &lt;- SyntheticData(SpeciesNum = 21, CommunityNum = 3,
                                 SpCo = NULL ,Length = 500,
                                 Parameters = list(a=rep(60, 3),
                                                   b=c(0,250,500),
                                                   c=rep(0.015,3)),
                                 pal = c("#008585", "#FBF2C4", "#C7522B"))

 ## Analyses:
 SyntheticEcoFinder &lt;- EcotoneFinder(data = SyntheticTrial[,-1],
                                     dist = SyntheticTrial$Distance,
                                     method = "all", groups = 3,
                                     standardize = "hellinger", diversity = "all")

 ## Slope calculation:
 SyntheticSlope &lt;- Slope(SyntheticEcoFinder, method = "all", axis.number = 2,
                         diversity = "all")
