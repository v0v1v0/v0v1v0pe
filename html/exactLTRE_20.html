<h2>Automated checks for a set of matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Run automated checks for a set of population projection matrices. This code will
check if the matrices are square, strictly non-negative, ergodic, irreducible,
and primitive. The last check is for whether the column sums are greater than 1
for presumed survival terms. For this portion, the code assumes that the first
row represents only fertility, and that all other matrix entries represent
only survival.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">run_matrix_checks(Aobj)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Aobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object containing the population projection matrices to be
included in the analysis. It should either be a list, or a matrix where each
row is the column-wise vectorization of a matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If all the checks pass, then nothing is returned. If one of the checks
fails, then an error or warning message will be returned.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">A1&lt;- matrix(data=c(0,0.8,0, 0,0,0.7, 5,0,0.2), nrow=3, ncol=3)
A2&lt;- matrix(data=c(0,0.9,0, 0,0,0.5, 4,0,0.3), nrow=3, ncol=3)
A3&lt;- matrix(data=c(0,0.4,0, 0,0,0.6, 6,0,0.25), nrow=3, ncol=3)
run_matrix_checks(list(A1,A2,A3))
# A couple of examples that would throw errors or warnings:
# run_matrix_checks(c(0,0.8,0, -1,0,0.7, 5,0,0.2)) # has a negative value
# run_matrix_checks(c(0,0.8,0, 0,0.5,0.7, 5,0,0.2)) # has a column-sum greater than 1
