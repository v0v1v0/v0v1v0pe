<h2>Evolutionary sequence (time-series) of phenotypic change in the number of ribs in the lineage Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Phenotypic data (ribs) from a centric diatom lineage Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis. The time series spans about 14 000 years.
The data set contains data on the number of costae (ribs) per valve.
The data consists of an objects of class paleoTS (ribs_S.yellowstonensis). Objects of class paleoTS can be analyzed in evoTS.
The object (trait data set) contains a vector of sample means (mm), sample variances (vv), sample sizes (nn) and sample ages (tt).
The oldest sample is listed first. The data spans an interval of 13728 years.
