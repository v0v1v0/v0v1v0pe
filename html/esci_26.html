<h2>Kardas Expt 4 - Ch07 - from Kardas and O'Brien (2018), Experiment 4</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to change the battery in your phone, cook the perfect
souffle, or perform a three-ball juggle. Just as numerous people do every
day, you might search online to find a video that shows what to do. Suppose
you watch such a video just once. First question: How well would you then
predict you could perform the task? Second question: How well would you
actually perform the task, the first time you tried? Now suppose you watch
the video many times: Again consider the two questions. These questions were
investigated in a series of studies by Kardas and O'Brien (2018). Let's first
do some quick analyses of Kardas Experiments 3 and 4-let's call them Expt 3
and Expt 4-focusing on the effect of watching a video many times rather than
once. Expt 4 was conducted online with participants recruited from Amazon's
Mechanical Turk, who are typically more diverse than students. The online
task was based on a mirror-drawing game developed by Bob and students (Cusack
et al., 2015, tiny.cc/bobmirrortrace). Participants first read a description
of the game and the scoring procedure. To play, you use your computer
trackpad to trace a target line, as accurately and quickly as you can. The
task is tricky because you can see only a mirror image of the path you are
tracing with a finger on the trackpad. A running score is displayed. The
final score is the percentage match between the target line and the path you
traced, so scores can range from 0 to 100
