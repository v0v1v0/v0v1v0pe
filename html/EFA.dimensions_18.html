<h2>Velicer's minimum average partial (MAP) test</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Velicer's minimum average partial (MAP) test for determining the number 
of components, which focuses on the common variance in a correlation matrix.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">MAP(data, corkind, Ncases, verbose)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>

<p>An all-numeric dataframe where the rows are cases &amp; the columns are the variables, 
or a correlation matrix with ones on the diagonal. The function internally determines 
whether the data are a correlation matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>corkind</code></td>
<td>

<p>The kind of correlation matrix to be used if data is not a correlation matrix. 
The options are 'pearson', 'kendall', 'spearman', 'gamma', and 'polychoric'. Required only if 
the entered data is not a correlation matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Ncases</code></td>
<td>

<p>The number of cases. Required only if data is a correlation matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>

<p>Should detailed results be displayed in console? TRUE (default) or FALSE</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method for determining the number 
of components focuses on the common variance in a correlation matrix. It involves 
a complete principal components analysis followed by the examination of a series 
of matrices of partial correlations. Specifically, on the first step, the first 
principal component is partialled out of the correlations between the variables 
of interest, and the average squared coefficient in the off-diagonals of the 
resulting partial correlation matrix is computed. On the second step, the first 
two principal components are partialled out of the original correlation matrix 
and the average squared partial correlation is again computed. These computations 
are conducted for k (the number of variables) minus one steps. The average squared 
partial correlations from these steps are then lined up, and the number of components 
is determined by the step number in the analyses that resulted in the lowest average 
squared partial correlation. The average squared coefficient in the original 
correlation matrix is also computed, and if this coefficient happens to be lower 
than the lowest average squared partial correlation, then no components should be 
extractioned from the correlation matrix. Statistically, components are retained as 
long as the variance in the correlation matrix represents systematic variance. 
Components are no longer retained when there is proportionately more unsystematic 
variance than systematic variance (see O'Connor, 2000, p. 397).
