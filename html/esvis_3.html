<h2>Synthetic benchmark screening data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Across the country many schools engage in seasonal benchmark screenings to 
monitor to progress of their students. These are relatively brief
assessments administered to "check-in" on students' progress throughout
the year. This dataset was simulated from a real dataset from one large
school district using the terrific 
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=synthpop">synthpop</a>
R package. Overall characteristics of the synthetic data are remarkably
similar to the real data.
