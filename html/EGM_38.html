<h2>Waveform Database (WFDB) Software Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This implementation of WFDB is a back-end for the WFDB using a combination of
<em>python</em>, <em>C++</em>, and <em>C</em> language. The related functions are documented
separately. This serves as an overview of the conversion of WFDB formats to R
formats. In this documentation, the specific WFDB generated files will be
described.
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>record</code></td>
<td>
<p>String that will be used to name the WFDB record. Cannot
include extensions, and is not a filepath. alphanumeric characters are
acceptable, as well as hyphens (-) and underscores (_)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>record_dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>File path of directory that should be used read and write
files. Defaults to current directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>annotator</code></td>
<td>
<p>String that is the name of a WFDB-compatible annotation
type, serving as the extension for the file that is written containing that
annotation. Please see <code>read_annotation()</code> and <code>write_annotation()</code> for
further details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wfdb_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path that leads to installed <code>wfdb</code> software package on
device. Needs to be directly set using <code>set_wfdb_path()</code>. Obtained from the
system options on loading of the package, <code>getOption('wfdb_path')</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments to be passed to the function</p>
</td>

<h3>WFDB</h3>

<p>The WFDB (Waveform Database) Software Package has been developed over the
past thirty years, providing a large collection of software for processing
and analyzing physiological waveforms. The package is written in highly
portable C and can be used on all popular platforms, including GNU/Linux,
MacOS X, MS-Windows, and all versions of Unix.
</p>
<p>The foundation of the WFDB Software Package is the WFDB library,
consisting of a set of functions for reading and writing digitized signals
and annotations. These functions can be used by programs written in C, C++,
or Fortran, running under any operating system for which an ANSI/ISO C
compiler is available, including all versions of Unix, MS-DOS, MS-Windows,
the Macintosh OS, and VMS.
</p>


<h3>Data format</h3>

<p>The records that the WFDB uses have three components...
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Signals: integer values that are at equal intervals at a certain sampling
frequency
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Header attributes: recording information such as sample number, gain,
sampling frequency
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Annotations: information about the record such as abeat
labels or alarm triggers
</p>
</li>
</ol>
