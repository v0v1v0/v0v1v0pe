<h2>Macnamara r ma - Ch11 - from Macnamara et al. (2014)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Is genius born or made? Could any of us be Michael Jordan or Mozart if we
worked sufficiently hard to develop the requisite skills? Meta-analysis of
correlations can help answer such questions. The issue here is the extent
that practice and effort may be sufficient for achieving the highest levels
of expertise. Ericsson et al. (1993) argued that years of effort is what
matters most: 'Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent
are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10
years' (p. 363). This view was enormously popularized by Malcolm Gladwell
(2008), who argued in his book Outliers that 10,000 hours of focused practice
is the key to achieving expertise. However, this view is now being
challenged, with one important contribution being a large meta-analysis of
correlations between amount of intense practice and level of achievement:
Macnamara et al. (2014) combined 157 correlations reported in a wide range of
fields, from sports to music and education, and found correlation of only r =
.35 (.30, .39). Table 11.1 shows the 16 main correlations for music, from
Macnamara et al. (2014).
