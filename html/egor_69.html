<h2>Transnational personal communities of social support of German migrants in Great Britain</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an <code>egor</code> object derived from a subset of the data of a personal network
study on support relationships German migrants living in the UK maintain. The data was collected in 2010 using respondent driven sampling (snowball sampling).
While the number of alters the respondents were allowed to enter was not limited, only a random subsample of up to eight alters were selected for the alter name interpreter and alter-alter tie questions.
This data set contains the data
for 50 of the originally 234 egos.
