<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The methodology in this function follows the methodology described in Lwanga and Lemeshow (1991).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing the following: 
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.total</code></td>
<td>
<p>the total number of subjects required for the specified level of confidence and power, respecting the requirement for <code>r</code> times as many individuals in the treatment group compared with the control group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.exp1</code></td>
<td>
<p>the total number of subjects in the treatment group for the specified level of confidence and power, respecting the requirement for <code>r</code> times as many individuals in the treatment group compared with the control group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.exp0</code></td>
<td>
<p>the total number of subjects in the control group for the specified level of confidence and power, respecting the requirement for <code>r</code> times as many individuals in the treatment group compared with the control group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p>the power of the study given the number of study subjects, the expected effect size and level of confidence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>irr</code></td>
<td>
<p>the incidence rate of the outcome in the exposed group divided by the incidence rate in the unexposed group (the incidence rate ratio).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The power of a study is its ability to demonstrate the presence of an association, given that an association actually exists.
</p>
<p>Values need to be entered for <code>irexp0</code>, <code>n</code>, and <code>power</code> to return a value for <code>irr</code>. In this situation, the lower value of <code>irr</code> represents the maximum detectable incidence rate ratio that is less than 1; the upper value of <code>irr</code> represents the minimum detectable incidence rate ratio greater than 1.
</p>
<p>See the documentation for <code>epi.sscohortc</code> for an example using the <code>design</code> facility implemented in this function.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1 (from Lwanga and Lemeshow 1991 p. 19):
## As part of a study of the long-term effect of noise on workers in a
## particularly noisy industry, it is planned to follow up a cohort of people
## who were recruited into the industry during a given period of time and to
## compare them with a similar cohort of individuals working in a much
## quieter industry. Subjects will be followed up for the rest of their lives or
## until their hearing is impaired. The results of a previous small-scale survey
## suggest that the annual incidence rate of hearing impairment in the noisy
## industry may be as high as 25%. How many people should be followed up
## in each of the groups (which are to be of equal size) to test the hypothesis
## that the incidence rates for hearing impairment in the two groups are the
## same, at the 5% level of significance and with a power of 80%? The
## alternative hypothesis is that the annual incidence rate for hearing
## impairment in the quieter industry is not more than the national average of
## about 10% (for people in the same age range), whereas in the noisy
## industry it differs from this.

## An annuual incidence rate of 25% is equivalent to 25 cases of hearing 
## impairment per 100 individuals per year.

epi.sscohortt(FT = NA, irexp1 = 0.25, irexp0 = 0.10, n = NA, power = 0.80, 
   r = 1, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)

## A total of 46 subjects are required for this study: 23 in the exposed 
## group and 23 in the unexposed group.


## EXAMPLE 2 (from Lwanga and Lemeshow 1991 p. 19):
## A study similar to that described above is to be undertaken, but the
## duration of the study will be limited to 5 years. How many subjects should
## be followed up in each group?

epi.sscohortt(FT = 5, irexp1 = 0.25, irexp0 = 0.10, n = NA, power = 0.80, 
   r = 1, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)

## A total of 130 subjects are required for this study: 65 in the exposed 
## group and 65 in the unexposed group.
