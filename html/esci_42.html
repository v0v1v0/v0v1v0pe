<h2>RattanMotivation - Ch14 - from Rattan et al. (2012)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>How do you think you would react to feedback that gave encouragement and
reassurance, or, instead, encouragement and challenge? Carol Dweck and her
colleagues have investigated many such questions about how people respond to
different types of feedback. My next example comes from Dweck's research
group and illustrates data analysis that starts with the full data, rather
than only summary statistics. Rattan et al. (2012) asked their college
student participants to imagine they were undertaking a mathematics course
and had just received a low score (65%) on the first test of the year.
Participants were assigned randomly into three groups, which received
different feedback along with the low score. The Comfort group received
positive encouragement and also reassurance, the Challenge group received
positive encouragement and also challenge, and the Control group received
just the positive encouragement. Participants then responded to a range of
questions about how they felt about the course and their professor. I'll
discuss data for their ratings of their own motivation toward mathematics,
made after they had received the feedback.
