<h2>Time to nominal temperature</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The time for a painted panel to reach a nominal temperature of -10 C
versus the temperature in a freezer to prepare the panel.  Two types
of panels were used, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) panels and
repair panels.  The repair panels have an extra coat of paint.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 24 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>time, in minutes, for the panel to reach the
nominal temperature of -10 C</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>temp</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>temperature in the freezer from which the panel
is extracted</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>type</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>Repair</code> <code>OEM</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A freezer is used to simulate exposure to cold on automotive paint
test panels.  A durability test is to be conducted at -10 C.  The test
is conducted on two types of panels (one type has an additional coat of
paint) and there is some time needed to retrieve the panel from the
freezer and to place it in the test equipment.  This study was run to
determine the optimal freezer setting for running the durability test.
