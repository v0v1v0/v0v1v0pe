<h2>Hagelloch measles data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Epidemic data derived from a measles outbreak in the town of 
Hagelloch, Germany in 1861.  188 individuals were infected over the 
course of the epidemic.  (One individual was removed from this dataset.)
</p>
<p>Consists of two files: HagellochTimes and HagellochDyadCov.  These two
files contain the data necessary to analyze the Hagelloch measles data.
</p>
<p>HagellochTimes contains 187 rows (one for each individual included) and
5 columns: NodeID (a numerical index ranging from 1 to 187); Putative
Parent (the ID of the individual considered most likely to have been
responsible for infecting this person, as determined by Osterle); Exposure 
time, Infectious time, and Removal time (the time index in days at which 
the individual entered the Exposed, Infectious, and Removed states,
respectively).  Note that Exposure times are not known for this data set.
See references below for details regarding the determination of 
Infectious and Removal times.
</p>
<p>HagellochDyadCov is a matrix of dyadic covariates corresponding to
the individuals in the Hagelloch data set.  Contains one row for each
dyad (pair of individuals) in the population.  The first two columns are the
Node IDs for the two individuals in the dyad.  The third column is a column
of all 1 values, used as a baseline or intercept term.  Columns 4, 5, and 6
are indicator variables for whether the two individuals in the dyad are in
the same household, are both in classroom 1, or both in classroom 2,
respectively.  Column 7 is the household distance between the two
individuals in the dyad, measured in units of 2.5m, Columns 8 and 9 are indicator
variables based on whether both individuals in the dyad are male or
female, respectively.  Column 10 is the age difference (in years) between
the two individuals in the dyad.
