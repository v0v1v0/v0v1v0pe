<h2>Use Expansion Rule to Simulate Ecological Diversification of a Biota.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implement Monte Carlo simulation of a biota undergoing ecological
diversification using the expansion rule.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">expansion(nreps = 1, Sseed, Smax, ecospace, method = "Euclidean", strength = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nreps</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of integers (such as a sequence) specifying sample number
produced. Only used when function is applied within <code>lapply</code> or
related function. Default <code>nreps=1</code> or any other integer produces a
single sample.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sseed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer giving number of species (or other taxa) to use at start
of simulation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Smax</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum number of species (or other taxa) to include in
simulation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ecospace</code></td>
<td>
<p>An ecospace framework (functional trait space) of class
<code>ecospace</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance measure to use when calculating functional distances
between species. Default is <code>Euclidean</code> using
<code>stats::dist</code>. <code>Gower</code> or any other value uses
Gower distance (using <code>FD::gowdis</code>). Presence of factor or
ordered factor character types forces use of Gower distance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strength</code></td>
<td>
<p>Strength parameter controlling probability that expansion
rule is followed during simulation. Values must range between
<code>strength = 1</code> (default, rules always implemented) and <code>strength = 0</code>
(rules never implemented).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Simulations are implemented as Monte Carlo processes in which
species are added iteratively to assemblages, with all added species having
their character states specified by the model rules, here the 'expansion'
rule. Simulations begin with the seeding of <code>Sseed</code> number of species,
chosen at random (with replacement) from either the species pool (if
provided in the <code>weight.file</code> when building the ecospace framework
using <code>create_ecospace</code>) or following the neutral-rule algorithm (if a
pool is not provided). Once seeded, the simulations proceed iteratively
(character-by-character, species-by-species) by following the appropriate
algorithm, as explained below, until terminated at <code>Smax</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Expansion rule algorithm:</strong>  Measure distances between all pairs of
species, using <code>Euclidean</code> or <code>Gower</code> distance method specified
by <code>method</code> argument. Identify species pair that is maximally distant.
If multiple pairs are equally maximally distant, one pair is chosen at
random. The newly added species has traits that are equal to or more
extreme than those in this species pair, with probability of following the
expansion rule determined by the <code>strength</code> parameter. Default
<code>strength = 1</code> always implements the rule, whereas <code>strength = 0</code>
never implements it (essentially making the simulation follow the
<code>neutral</code> rule.)
</p>
<p>Each newly assigned character is compared with the ecospace framework
(<code>ecospace</code>) to confirm that it is an allowed state combination before
proceeding to the next character. If the newly built character is
disallowed from the ecospace framework (i.e., because it has "dual
absences" [0,0], has been excluded based on the species pool
[<code>weight.file</code> in <code>create_ecospace</code>], or is not allowed by the
ecospace <code>constraint</code> parameter), then the character-selection
algorithm is repeated until an allowable character is selected. When
simulations proceed to very large sample sizes (&gt;100), this confirmatory
process can require long computational times, and produce "new" species
that are functionally identical to pre-existing species. This can occur,
for example, when no life habits, or perhaps only one, exist that forms an
allowable novelty between the selected neighbors.
</p>
<p>Expansion rules tend to produce ecospaces that progressively expand into
more novel regions. Additional details on the expansion simulation are
provided in Novack-Gottshall (2016a,b), including sensitivity to
ecospace framework (functional trait space) structure, recommendations for
model selection, and basis in ecological and evolutionary theory.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame with <code>Smax</code> rows (representing species) and
as many columns as specified by number of characters/states (functional
traits) in the ecospace framework. Columns will have the same data type
(numeric, factor, ordered numeric, or ordered factor) as specified in the
ecospace framework.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>A bug exists within <code>FD::gowdis</code> where nearest-neighbor
distances can not be calculated when certain characters (especially numeric
characters with values other than 0 and 1) share identical traits across
species. The nature of the bug is under investigation, but the current
implementation is reliable under most uses. If you run into problems
because of this bug, a work-around is to manually change the function to
call <code>cluster::daisy</code> using <code>metric = "gower"</code>
instead.
</p>
<p>The function has been written to allow usage (using <code>lapply</code> or
some other list-apply function) in 'embarrassingly parallel' implementations
in a high-performance computing environment.
