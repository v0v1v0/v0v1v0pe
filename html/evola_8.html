<strong>EVOL</strong>utionary <strong>A</strong>lgorithm

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The evola package is nice wrapper of the AlphaSimR package that enables the use of the evolutionary algorithm to solve complex questions in a simple form.
</p>
<p>The <code>evolafit</code> function is the core function of the package which allows the user to specify the problem and constraints to find a close-to-optimal solution using the evolutionary forces.
</p>


<h3>Keeping evola updated</h3>

<p>The evola package is updated on CRAN every 4-months due to CRAN policies but you can find the latest source at https://github.com/covaruber/evola. This can be easily installed typing the following in the R console:
</p>
<p>library(devtools)
</p>
<p>install_github("covaruber/evola")
</p>
<p>This is recommended if you reported a bug, was fixed and was immediately pushed to GitHub but not in CRAN until the next update.
</p>


<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>For tutorials on how to perform different analysis with evola please look at the vignettes by typing in the terminal:
</p>
<p><strong>vignette("evola.intro")</strong>
</p>


<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>The package has been equiped with several datasets to learn how to use the evola package: 
</p>
<p>* <code>DT_technow</code> dataset to perform optimal cross selection. 
</p>
<p>* <code>DT_wheat</code> dataset to perform optimal training population selection.
</p>
<p>* <code>DT_cpdata</code> dataset to perform optimal individual. 
</p>


<h3>Models Enabled</h3>

<p>The machinery behind the scenes is AlphaSimR.
</p>


<h3>Bug report and contact</h3>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions please post it in https://stackoverflow.com or https://stats.stackexchange.com
</p>
<p>I'll be glad to help or answer any question. I have spent a valuable amount of time developing this package. Please cite this package in your publication. Type 'citation("evola")' to know how to cite it.
