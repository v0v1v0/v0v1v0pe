<h2>
Simulated monocyte counts and psychosis symptoms.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Discretised values of monocyte counts, and ratings of level of
psychosis simulated from a model fitted to a data set consisting of
observations made on a number of patients from the Northland District
Health Board system.  The real data must be kept confidential due
to ethics constraints.
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The data sets are named <code>bivarSim</code> and <code>cSim</code>.
</p>
<p>These data are <b>not</b> immediately available in the <code>eglhmm</code>
package.  Their presence would cause the size of the <code>data</code>
directory to exceed 4.5 Mb., which is unacceptably large.
Consequently these data sets have been placed in a separate
“data only” package called <code>monoCyteSim</code>, which is
available from <code>github</code>.  This package may be obtained by
executing the command:
</p>
<pre>
    install.packages("monoCyteSim",repos="https://rolfturner.r-universe.dev")
</pre>
<p>After having installed the <code>monoCyteSim</code> package, you may load
it via <code>library(monoCyteSim)</code> and then access the data sets
in the usual way, e.g. <code>X &lt;- ccSim</code>.
</p>
<p>Alternatively (after having installed the <code>monoCyteSim</code>
package) you may use the <code>::</code> syntax to access a single data
set, e.g. <code>X &lt;- monoCyteSim::ccSim</code>.
</p>
<p>You can access the documentation via, e.g., <code>?monoCyteSim::ccSim</code>.
