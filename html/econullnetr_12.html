<h2>Flower visitation network from an arable field in the UK</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A flower visitation network from an arable field site in the UK, notable for
the presence of small-flowered catchfly <em>Silene gallica</em>, a rare arable
weed species in the UK.  Flower visitors and floral abundance were sampled on
11 occasions in the summer of 2002, with all insect flower visitors (31 taxa)
recorded on the flower species where they were observed. Gibson <em>et al</em>.
(2006) provide full details of the data and analysis of the results.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Silene
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 128 rows and seven columns, one row for each individual
pollinator. The first column (<code>Visit</code>) represents the sampling occasion
on which the pollinator was collected (V1–V11), the second column
(<code>Insect</code>) represents the flower visitor taxon, and the remaining five
columns are the five flower species, which were either visited (1) or not (0)
by each insect.
