<h2>Computes several values of the flow duration curve for streamflow centered on a specific date of the year</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is useful for helping the analyst determine the empirical probability distribution of 
streamflow for a particular part of the year or for the whole year. 
This is particularly useful in setting up discharge scales for various other plots in this package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">flowDuration(eList, centerDate = "09-30", qUnit = 2, span = 365,
  monthLab = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eList</code></td>
<td>
<p>named list with at least Daily and INFO dataframes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>centerDate</code></td>
<td>
<p>character specifying the center date of the part of the year for which the flow
duration is to be calculated, it is in the form "mm-dd" (it must be in quotes). Default is 
"09-30"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>qUnit</code></td>
<td>
<p>object of qUnit class <code>printqUnitCheatSheet</code>, or numeric represented the short code,
or character representing the descriptive name. Default is qUnit = 2, which corresponds to cubic meters per second.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>span</code></td>
<td>
<p>number this is the half-width of the window over which the discharge values are to 
be used in constructing the flow-duration curve. If the full year is desired any value greater 
than 182 will. Note that for a window of about 2-months width, a span value should 
be about 30. Default is 365.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>monthLab</code></td>
<td>
<p>object of monthLabel class, or numeric represented the short code, 
or character representing the descriptive name.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>qDuration A named vector with flow duration information.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">eList &lt;- Choptank_eList
# for a window of 30 days either side of June 25 expressed in units
# of cfs:
flowDuration(eList, "06-25", qUnit = 1, span = 30) 
# for a flow-duration curve covering the whole year, 
# expressed in units of cms, and returning a data frame of results: 
qDuration &lt;- flowDuration(eList, qUnit = 2) 
</code></pre>
