<h2>Regression toy dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simple dataset containing simulated values for a numeric response variable
and four covariates of both mixed and partially structured type. The data
generation process is based on Section 5 (”Example: synthetic data”) from
Serban and Wasserman (2005).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data_reg
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>List with two elements: <code>covs</code>, which is a list containing the
covariates, and <code>resp</code>, which is a numeric vector of length 200
representing the response variable. The response variable is specified as
in Serban and Wasserman (2005). The four covariates in <code>covs</code> all have
length 200 and are characterized as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Nominal: level 0 for observations having negative response variable,
level 1 otherwise;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Numeric: coefficients for one of the basis used to perform the
B-splines expansion of the curves that are in turn specified as in Serban and
Wasserman (2005);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Functional: curves as specified in Serban and Wasserman (2005), with 50
observations coming from each of the four curve shapes;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Graphs: Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs with connection probability given by
a transformation of the response variable obtained standardizing between 0.2
and 0.8 its value after adding a normally distributed noise with mean 0 and
standard deviation 7.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
