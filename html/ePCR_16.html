<h2>Penalized Ensemble Predictor (PEP) S4-class ensemble consisting of individual PSP-members</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This class constructs an ensemble of individual Penalized Ensemble Predictor (PSP-class) members. Each member contributes to the model output equally, and ensemble-level functions wrap up individual predictions into an averaged ensemble prediction. The user may define an arbitrary number of PSPs and tailor them to suit the particular needs, and then provide them as a list to the PEP-constructor. As such, constructing well tailored individual ensemble members (of PSP-class) in order to produce a powerful ensemble (of PEP-class) is important on both levels.
