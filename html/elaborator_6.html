<h2>Calculates the distance matrix based on Spearman's correlation coefficient</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function derives the Spearman correlation coefficients for a data matrix and transforms the resulting similarity matrix into a distance/dissimilarity matrix. No difference is made between positive and negative correlations, i.e., correlations of -1 and 1 will be transformed to a distance of 0; correlations of 0 will be transformed to a distance of 1. Missing values in the input data will be handled by casewise deletion.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A distance matrix of class "dist", which can be used for example for a seriation algorithm
