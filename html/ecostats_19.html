<h2>Ravens data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a study of whether ravens fly towards the sound of gunshots (White 2005). Many thanks to Crow White for providing the raw data. There were twelve locations, at which four treatments were applied (1=gunshot, 2-air horn, 3=whistle, 4=no sound).
Ravens within a 100 metre radius of the author were counted ten minutes before and ten minutes after each treatment was applied.
Primary interest was in assessing if there was an effect of gunshot on raven numbers. Posthoc analyses
suggested that ravens were attracted to gunshots in forested areas only.
