<h2>Lethal time data for seasonal exposure to TFM for larval sea lamprey</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains the amount of responding/dead lamprey from 1 to 12 h of exposure to the piscicide, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), for the calculated LC50s at each month for the 2011 seasonal larval sea lamprey TFM toxicity data.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each month, new lamprey were collected from the deer creek, MI, and were randomly assigned to a tank for exposure to the piscicide, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM). The LC50 at each month was then calculated and the amount of responding/dead lamprey from 1 to 12 h was recorded.
