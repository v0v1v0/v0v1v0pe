<h2>Predict event time for ongoing subjects with or without cured population.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Utilizes pre-fitted time-to-event and time-to-dropout models
to generate event and dropout times for ongoing subjects
and new subjects. It also provides a
prediction interval for the expected time to reach the target
number of events.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To ensure successful event prediction at the design stage, it is
important to provide the <code>newSubjects</code> data set.
</p>
<p>To specify the event model used during the design-stage event
prediction, the <code>event_fit</code> be a list with one element
per treatment. For each treatment, the element should include <code>w</code>
to specify the weight of the treatment in a randomization block,
<code>model</code> to specify the event model
(exponential, weibull, log-logistic, log-normal,
or piecewise exponential, weibull with cured population,exponential with cured population,log-normal with cured population,
log-logistic with cured population,piecewise exponential with cured population,
exponential with cured population and delayed treatment,weibull with cured population and delayed treatment,
log-normal with cured population and delayed treatment,log-logistic with cured population and delayed treatment),
<code>theta</code> and <code>vtheta</code> to indicate
the parameter values and the covariance matrix.
For the piecewise exponential or piecewise exponential with cured population or piecewise exponential with cured population
and delayed treatment event model, the list
should also include <code>piecewiseSurvivalTime</code> to indicate
the location of knots. It should be noted that the model averaging
and spline options are not appropriate for use as prior.
</p>
<p>To specify the dropout model used during the design stage
event prediction, the <code>dropout_fit</code> should be a list
with one element per treatment. For each treatment, the element
should include <code>w</code> to specify the weight of the treatment
in a randomization block, <code>model</code> to specify the dropout model
(exponential, weibull, log-logistic, log-normal,
or piecewise exponential), <code>theta</code> and <code>vtheta</code> to indicate
the parameter values and the covariance matrix.
For the piecewise exponential dropout model, the list
should also include <code>piecewiseDropoutTime</code> to indicate
the location of knots.
</p>
<p>Following the commencement of the trial, we obtain the event
model fit and the dropout model fit based on the observed data,
denoted as <code>event_fit</code> and <code>dropout_fit</code>, respectively.
These fitted models are subsequently utilized to generate event
and dropout times for both ongoing and new subjects in the trial.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of prediction results which includes important
information such as the median, lower and upper percentiles for
the estimated day and date to reach the target number of events,
as well as simulated event data for both ongoing and new subjects.
The data for the prediction plot is also included
within this list.
