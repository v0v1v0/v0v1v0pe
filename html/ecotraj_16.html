<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Briefly, Cucherousset et al. (2013) released 192 individually tagged, hatchery-raised, juvenile pike (Esox lucius L.) with variable initial trophic position (fin delta 13C/delta 15N values).
Based on delta values, individuals were classified into zooplanktivorous (delta 15N &lt; 10 ‰) and piscivorous (delta 15N &gt; 10 ‰) as cannibalism is commonly observed in this species.
Individuals were released in a temporarily flooded grassland where pike eggs usually hatch of the Brière marsh (France) to identify the determinants of juvenile natal departure.
The release site was connected through a unique point to an adjacent pond used as a nursery habitat. Fish were continuously recaptured when migrating from flooded grassland
to adjacent pond. Recaptured individuals (n = 29) were anaesthetized, checked for tags, measured for fork length, fin-clipped to quantify changes in delta 13C and delta 15N values,
and released.
