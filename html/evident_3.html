<h3>Details</h3>

<p>On 1 April 1992, the state of New Jersy increased its minimum wage from 4.25 dollars per hour to 5.05 dollars per hour, while adjacent Pennsylvania made no change.  David Card and Alan Krueger studied the change in employment at fast food restaurants, from before the wage increase to after, based on survey data they collected.
</p>
<p>There are three groups matched for HRSOPEN and indicators of the CHAIN.   PA are restaurants in eastern Pennsylvania, adjacent to western New Jersey.  NJlow are New Jersey restaurants with a starting wage of at most 4.50 dollars in February 1992, and NJhigh are New Jersey restaurants with a starting wage of more than 4.50 dollars.  The NJlow restaurants were required to increase the starting wage by substantially more than the NJhigh restaurants.
</p>
<p>The match was built using the algorithm of Karmakar et al. (2019) and the approximatch package in R.
</p>
<p>Used as an example in Rosenbaum (2021).
</p>
<p>Using a different matched sample, an analysis of two evidence factors in Card and Krueger's study is given in Rosenbaum (2010).
