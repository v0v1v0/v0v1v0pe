<h2>
Simplified Engle-Granger Cointegration Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides a simplified implementation of the Engle-Granger
cointegration model that is geared towards the analysis of securities prices.
Summary and plot functions are provided, and a convenient interface to
<span class="pkg">quantmod</span> is given. A variety of standard unit root tests are supported,
and an improved unit root test is included.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package implements a test for a simplified form of cointegration. Namely,
it checks whether or not a linear combination of two time series follows an
autoregressive model of order one. In other words, given two series <code class="reqn">X</code> and
<code class="reqn">Y</code>, it searches for parameters <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>, <code class="reqn">\beta</code> and <code class="reqn">\rho</code>
such that:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">Y[i] = \alpha + \beta * X[i] + R[i]</code>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">R[i] = \rho * R[i-1] + \epsilon</code>
</p>

<p>If <code class="reqn">|\rho| &lt; 1</code>, then <code class="reqn">X</code> and <code class="reqn">Y</code> are cointegrated.
</p>
<p>Cointegration is a useful tool in many areas of economics, but this
implementation is especially geared towards the analysis of securities
prices.  Testing for cointegration has been proposed as means for assessing
whether or not two securities are suitable candidates for pairs trading.
</p>
<p>In addition, this package implements two previously unavailable unit root tests.
A test based upon the weighted symmetric estimator <code class="reqn">\rho_{ws}</code> of Pantula,
Gonzales-Farias and Fuller is implemented as <code>pgff.test</code>. This test seems
to provide superior performance to the standard Dickey-Fuller test
<code>adf.test</code> and also improves upon the performance of a number of other
tests previously available in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>
<p>The variance ratio test proposed by J. Breitung is implemented as
<code>bvr.test</code>.  It has the advantage that it is a non-parametric test,
and it seems to provide superior performance to other variance ratio
tests available in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>, although it does not perform as well as <code>pgff.test</code>.
</p>
<p>Users who wish to explore more general models for cointegration are
referred to the <code>urca</code> package of Bernard Pfaff.
