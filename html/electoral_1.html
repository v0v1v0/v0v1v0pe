<h2>Electoral Competitiveness</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Electoral competitiveness measures the difference in the percentages of valid votes obtained by the two most voted parties in a given territorial unit. It identifies the level of rivalry between the parties who occupied the first and second places in an election. Consejo Nacional Electoral del Ecuador (2014).
The formula is:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">Competitiveness = 1 - (p1 - p2)</code>
</p>

<p>where p1 and p2 are the 2 votes o seats proportions for the 2 most voted parties. Thus, it requires elections with at least 2 parties.
</p>
<p>The index is a number from 0 to 1, 0 means no competitiveness (p1 = 1 and p2 = 0) and 1 means maximum competitiveness (p1 = p2).
