<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The nature reserve of Landes et Marais de Glomel (Brittany, France) is
composed of temperate Atlantic wet heaths whose reference state is commonly
considered dominated by plant communities associated to acid, nutrient poor soils
that are at least seasonally water logged and dominated by <em>Erica tetralix</em> and
<em>E. ciliaris</em>. The data set consists of 23 rows and 46 columns.
The first five stations (rows) were used to define the reference
envelope, and the next 18 stations (rows) where those for which the conservation status
was to be assessed.
