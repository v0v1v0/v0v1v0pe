<h3>Details</h3>

<p><em>What is a Simultaneous Prediction Interval?</em> <br>
A prediction interval for some population is an interval on the real line constructed
so that it will contain <code class="reqn">k</code> future observations from that population
with some specified probability <code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code>, where
<code class="reqn">0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1</code> and <code class="reqn">k</code> is some pre-specified positive integer.
The quantity <code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code> is called
the confidence coefficient or confidence level associated with the prediction
interval.  The function <code>predIntNorm</code> computes a standard prediction
interval based on a sample from a normal distribution.
</p>
<p>The function <code>predIntNormSimultaneous</code> computes a simultaneous prediction
interval that will contain a certain number of future observations with probability
<code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code> for each of <code class="reqn">r</code> future sampling “occasions”,
where <code class="reqn">r</code> is some pre-specified positive integer.  The quantity <code class="reqn">r</code> may
refer to <code class="reqn">r</code> distinct future sampling occasions in time, or it may for example
refer to sampling at <code class="reqn">r</code> distinct locations on one future sampling occasion,
assuming that the population standard deviation is the same at all of the <code class="reqn">r</code>
distinct locations.
</p>
<p>The function <code>predIntNormSimultaneous</code> computes a simultaneous prediction
interval based on one of three possible rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For the <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule (<code>rule="k.of.m"</code>), at least <code class="reqn">k</code> of
the next <code class="reqn">m</code> future observations will fall in the prediction
interval with probability <code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code> on each of the <code class="reqn">r</code> future
sampling occasions.  If obserations are being taken sequentially, for a particular
sampling occasion, up to <code class="reqn">m</code> observations may be taken, but once
<code class="reqn">k</code> of the observations fall within the prediction interval, sampling can stop.
Note:  When <code class="reqn">k=m</code> and <code class="reqn">r=1</code>, the results of <code>predIntNormSimultaneous</code>
are equivalent to the results of <code>predIntNorm</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the California rule (<code>rule="CA"</code>), with probability
<code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code>, for each of the <code class="reqn">r</code> future sampling occasions, either
the first observation will fall in the prediction interval, or else all of the next
<code class="reqn">m-1</code> observations will fall in the prediction interval. That is, if the first
observation falls in the prediction interval then sampling can stop.  Otherwise,
<code class="reqn">m-1</code> more observations must be taken.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the Modified California rule (<code>rule="Modified.CA"</code>), with probability
<code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code>, for each of the <code class="reqn">r</code> future sampling occasions, either the
first observation will fall in the prediction interval, or else at least 2 out of
the next 3 observations will fall in the prediction interval.  That is, if the first
observation falls in the prediction interval then sampling can stop.  Otherwise, up
to 3 more observations must be taken.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Simultaneous prediction intervals can be extended to using averages (means) in place
of single observations (USEPA, 2009, Chapter 19).  That is, you can create a
simultaneous prediction interval
that will contain a specified number of averages (based on which rule you choose) on
each of <code class="reqn">r</code> future sampling occassions, where each each average is based on
<code class="reqn">w</code> individual observations.  For the function <code>predIntNormSimultaneous</code>,
the argument <code>n.mean</code> corresponds to <code class="reqn">w</code>.
<br></p>
<p><em>The Form of a Prediction Interval for 1 Future Observation</em> <br>
Let <code class="reqn">\underline{x} = x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</code> denote a vector of <code class="reqn">n</code>
observations from a normal distribution with parameters
<code>mean=</code><code class="reqn">\mu</code> and <code>sd=</code><code class="reqn">\sigma</code>.  Also, let <code class="reqn">w</code> denote the
sample size associated with the future averages (i.e., <code>n.mean=</code><code class="reqn">w</code>).
When <code class="reqn">w=1</code>, each average is really just a single observation, so in the rest of
this help file the term “averages” will replace the phrase
“observations or averages”.
</p>
<p>For a normal distribution, the form of a two-sided <code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code>
prediction interval is:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">[\bar{x} - Ks, \bar{x} + Ks] \;\;\;\;\;\; (1)</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">\bar{x}</code> denotes the sample mean:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \;\;\;\;\;\; (2)</code>
</p>

<p><code class="reqn">s</code> denotes the sample standard deviation:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \;\;\;\;\;\; (3)</code>
</p>

<p>and <code class="reqn">K</code> denotes a constant that depends on the sample size <code class="reqn">n</code>, the
confidence level, the number of future sampling occassions <code class="reqn">r</code>, and the
sample size associated with the future averages, <code class="reqn">w</code>.  Do not confuse the
constant <code class="reqn">K</code> (uppercase K) with the number of future averages <code class="reqn">k</code>
(lowercase k) in the <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule.  The symbol <code class="reqn">K</code> is used here
to be consistent with the notation used for tolerance intervals
(see <code>tolIntNorm</code>).
</p>
<p>Similarly, the form of a one-sided lower prediction interval is:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">[\bar{x} - Ks, \infty] \;\;\;\;\;\; (4)</code>
</p>

<p>and the form of a one-sided upper prediction interval is:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">[-\infty, \bar{x} + Ks] \;\;\;\;\;\; (5)</code>
</p>

<p>The derivation of the constant <code class="reqn">K</code> is explained in the help file for
<code>predIntNormK</code>.
<br></p>
<p><em>The Form of a Simultaneous Prediction Interval</em> <br><b>For <em>simultaneous</em> prediction intervals, only lower 
(<code>pi.type="lower"</code>) and upper (<code>pi.type="upper"</code>) prediction
intervals are available.</b>  Two-sided simultaneous prediction intervals were 
available in Versions 2.4.0 - 2.8.1 of <em>EnvStats</em>, but these prediction 
intervals were based on an incorrect algorithm for <code class="reqn">K</code>.
</p>
<p>Equations (4) and (5) above hold for simultaneous prediction intervals, but the 
derivation of the constant <code class="reqn">K</code> is more difficult, and is explained in the help file for
<code>predIntNormSimultaneousK</code>.
<br></p>
<p><em>Prediction Intervals are Random Intervals</em> <br>
A prediction interval is a <em>random</em> interval; that is, the lower and/or
upper bounds are random variables computed based on sample statistics in the
baseline sample.  Prior to taking one specific baseline sample, the probability
that the prediction interval will perform according to the rule chosen is
<code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code>.  Once a specific baseline sample is taken and the prediction
interval based on that sample is computed, the probability that that prediction
interval will perform according to the rule chosen is not necessarily
<code class="reqn">(1-\alpha)100\%</code>, but it should be close.  See the help file for
<code>predIntNorm</code> for more information.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>x</code> is a numeric vector, <code>predIntNormSimultaneous</code> returns a list of
class <code>"estimate"</code> containing the estimated parameters, the prediction interval,
and other information.  See the help file for <br><code>estimate.object</code> for details.
</p>
<p>If <code>x</code> is the result of calling an estimation function,
<code>predIntNormSimultaneous</code> returns a list whose class is the same as <code>x</code>.
The list contains the same components as <code>x</code>, as well as a component called
<code>interval</code> containing the prediction interval information.
If <code>x</code> already has a component called <code>interval</code>, this component is
replaced with the prediction interval information.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><em>Motivation</em> <br>
Prediction and tolerance intervals have long been applied to quality control and
life testing problems (Hahn, 1970b,c; Hahn and Nelson, 1973).  In the context of
environmental statistics, prediction intervals are useful for analyzing data from
groundwater detection monitoring programs at hazardous and solid waste facilities.
</p>
<p>One of the main statistical problems that plague groundwater monitoring programs at
hazardous and solid waste facilities is the requirement of testing several wells and
several constituents at each well on each sampling occasion.  This is an obvious
multiple comparisons problem, and the naive approach of using a standard t-test at
a conventional <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>-level (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) for each test leads to a
very high probability of at least one significant result on each sampling occasion,
when in fact no contamination has occurred.  This problem was pointed out years ago
by Millard (1987) and others.
</p>
<p>Davis and McNichols (1987) proposed simultaneous prediction intervals as a way of
controlling the facility-wide false positive rate (FWFPR) while maintaining adequate
power to detect contamination in the groundwater.  Because of the ubiquitous presence
of spatial variability, it is usually best to use simultaneous prediction intervals
at each well (Davis, 1998a).  That is, by constructing prediction intervals based on
background (pre-landfill) data on each well, and comparing future observations at a
well to the prediction interval for that particular well.  In each of these cases,
the individual <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>-level at each well is equal to the FWFRP divided by the
product of the number of wells and constituents.
</p>
<p>Often, observations at downgradient wells are not available prior to the
construction and operation of the landfill.  In this case, upgradient well data can
be combined to create a background prediction interval, and observations at each
downgradient well can be compared to this prediction interval.  If spatial
variability is present and a major source of variation, however, this method is not
really valid (Davis, 1994; Davis, 1998a).
</p>
<p>Chapter 19 of USEPA (2009) contains an extensive discussion of using the
<code class="reqn">1</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule and the Modified California rule.
</p>
<p>Chapters 1 and 3 of Gibbons et al. (2009) discuss simultaneous prediction intervals
for the normal and lognormal distributions, respectively.
<br></p>
<p><em>The k-of-m Rule</em> <br>
For the <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule, Davis and McNichols (1987) give tables with
“optimal” choices of <code class="reqn">k</code> (in terms of best power for a given overall
confidence level) for selected values of <code class="reqn">m</code>, <code class="reqn">r</code>, and <code class="reqn">n</code>.  They found
that the optimal ratios of <code class="reqn">k</code> to <code class="reqn">m</code> (i.e., <code class="reqn">k/m</code>) are generally small,
in the range of 15-50%.
<br></p>
<p><em>The California Rule</em> <br>
The California rule was mandated in that state for groundwater monitoring at waste
disposal facilities when resampling verification is part of the statistical program
(Barclay's Code of California Regulations, 1991).  The California code mandates a
“California” rule with <code class="reqn">m \ge 3</code>.  The motivation for this rule may have
been a desire to have a majority of the observations in bounds (Davis, 1998a).  For
example, for a <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule with <code class="reqn">k=1</code> and <code class="reqn">m=3</code>, a monitoring
location will pass if the first observation is out of bounds, the second resample
is out of bounds, but the last resample is in bounds, so that 2 out of 3 observations
are out of bounds.  For the California rule with <code class="reqn">m=3</code>, either the first
observation must be in bounds, or the next 2 observations must be in bounds in order
for the monitoring location to pass.
</p>
<p>Davis (1998a) states that if the FWFPR is kept constant, then the California rule
offers little increased power compared to the <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule, and can
actually decrease the power of detecting contamination.
<br></p>
<p><em>The Modified California Rule</em> <br>
The Modified California Rule was proposed as a compromise between a 1-of-<code class="reqn">m</code>
rule and the California rule.  For a given FWFPR, the Modified California rule
achieves better power than the California rule, and still requires at least as many
observations in bounds as out of bounds, unlike a 1-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule.
<br></p>
<p><em>Different Notations Between Different References</em> <br>
For the <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rule described in this help file, both
Davis and McNichols (1987) and USEPA (2009, Chapter 19) use the variable
<code class="reqn">p</code> instead of <code class="reqn">k</code> to represent the minimum number
of future observations the interval should contain on each of the <code class="reqn">r</code> sampling
occasions.
</p>
<p>Gibbons et al. (2009, Chapter 1) presents extensive lists of the value of
<code class="reqn">K</code> for both <code class="reqn">k</code>-of-<code class="reqn">m</code> rules and California rules.  Gibbons et al.'s
notation reverses the meaning of <code class="reqn">k</code> and <code class="reqn">r</code> compared to the notation used
in this help file.  That is, in Gibbons et al.'s notation, <code class="reqn">k</code> represents the
number of future sampling occasions or monitoring wells, and <code class="reqn">r</code> represents the
minimum number of observations the interval should contain on each sampling occasion.
</p>
<p>USEPA (2009, Chapter 19) uses <code class="reqn">p</code> in place of <code class="reqn">k</code>.

  #==========

  # Example 19-1 of USEPA (2009, p. 19-17) shows how to compute an
  # upper simultaneous prediction limit for the 1-of-3 rule for
  # r = 2 future sampling occasions.  The data for this example are
  # stored in EPA.09.Ex.19.1.sulfate.df.

  # We will pool data from 4 background wells that were sampled on
  # a number of different occasions, giving us a sample size of
  # n = 25 to use to construct the prediction limit.

  # There are 50 compliance wells and we will monitor 10 different
  # constituents at each well at each of the r=2 future sampling
  # occasions.  To determine the confidence level we require for
  # the simultaneous prediction interval, USEPA (2009) recommends
  # setting the individual Type I Error level at each well to

  # 1 - (1 - SWFPR)^(1 / (Number of Constituents * Number of Wells))

  # which translates to setting the confidence limit to

  # (1 - SWFPR)^(1 / (Number of Constituents * Number of Wells))

  # where SWFPR = site-wide false positive rate.  For this example, we
  # will set SWFPR = 0.1.  Thus, the confidence level is given by:

  nc &lt;- 10
  nw &lt;- 50
  SWFPR &lt;- 0.1
  conf.level &lt;- (1 - SWFPR)^(1 / (nc * nw))
