<h2>create a dominance matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>create a dominance matrix from the underlying observed sequence
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">creatematrix(
  eloobject,
  daterange = NULL,
  drawmethod = "omit",
  onlyinteracting = FALSE,
  winners,
  losers,
  draw = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eloobject</code></td>
<td>
<p>output from <code>elo.seq</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>daterange</code></td>
<td>
<p>character of length 2, date range to which the matrix should correspond (default from beginning to end of sequence)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drawmethod</code></td>
<td>
<p>character with the following options:<br><code>"omit"</code> = undecided interactions (draws/ties) are ignored (default)<br><code>"0.5"</code> = each undecided is counted half a win for each dyad member<br><code>"1"</code> = each undecided interaction is counted twice, i.e. as win for both individuals</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>onlyinteracting</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, indicating whether all individuals that were present (default, <code>TRUE</code>) are shown in the matrix, or only those that were involved in an interaction in the specified date period. If no presence data was supplied to <code>elo.seq</code>, it is assumed that all individuals were present at all times</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>winners</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of winners (see details)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>losers</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of losers (see details)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>draw</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical vector (currently not doing anything)</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function works with either the output of <code>elo.seq</code>, or with two vectors of winners and losers. If you use winner and loser vectors, their arguments need to be named, and also the remaining arguments (<code>daterange=</code> and <code>onlyinteracting=</code>) are ignored. The function does not yet allow to include draws if you supply winner/loser vectors. If you go via the <code>elo.seq</code>-route, the function can handle draws (via the <code>drawmethod=</code> argument).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>square matrix with dominance interactions (winner in rows, loser in columns)

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(adv)
# from winner/loser sequence directly
creatematrix(winners=adv$winner, losers=adv$loser)
# via an eloobject
SEQ &lt;- elo.seq(winner=adv$winner, loser=adv$loser, Date=adv$Date)
# create dyadic matrix over the entire period of data collection
creatematrix(SEQ)
# limit to a subset of interactions
creatematrix(SEQ, daterange=c("2010-01-25", "2010-02-01"))
# limit to a subset of interactions and show only those IDs that were
# involved in at least one interaction
creatematrix(SEQ, daterange=c("2010-01-25", "2010-02-01"),
             onlyinteracting=TRUE)
             
# interactions restricted to single date
creatematrix(SEQ, daterange = c("2010-01-25", "2010-01-25"))

## dealing with undecided interactions
data(adv2)
SEQ &lt;- elo.seq(winner=adv2$winner, loser=adv2$loser, Date=adv2$Date,
               draw=adv2$tie)
# omit ties/draws
creatematrix(SEQ)
# omit ties/draws
creatematrix(SEQ, drawmethod="0.5")
# omit ties/draws
creatematrix(SEQ, drawmethod="1")
