<h2>Rates of use of epidural anaesthesia in trials of caregiver support</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set provides results of six trials investigating rates of use of epidural anaesthesia during childbirth. Each trial is made up of a group where a caregiver (midwife, nurse) provided support intervention and a group where standard care was provided. The objective was to determine if there were higher rates of epidural use when a caregiver was present at birth.
