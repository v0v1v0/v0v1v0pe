<h2>Part of the highly-resolved food web from Broadstone Stream, UK</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Part of the highly-resolved macroinvertebrate food web from Broadstone Stream
in south-east England (see Woodward <em>et al</em>., 2005 for full details of
the web). This data frame contains data collected in August 1996, with 19
macroinvertebrate taxa. Predation was determined via visual gut contents
analysis, with identification of hard parts allowing counts of the number of
individual prey organisms each individual predator consumed.
There are three accompanying data sets:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>Broadstone.prey</code> Gives the total abundance of each prey taxon
from 30 Surber samples collected at the same time as the interaction data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Broadstone.fl</code> Specifies 'forbidden' links which are not
allowed in the null model.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Broadstone.nodes</code> The abundance and mean body mass for each
taxon in the food web in a format for use alongside a
<code>generate_null_model</code> object with the <code>cheddar</code> package
(Hudson <em>et al</em>., 2013). Body size is taken from cheddar's
'BroadstoneStream' data set.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Broadstone
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 319 rows and 20 columns. Each row represents the gut
contents of an individual predator. There are 20 columns in total, with the
first column (<code>Predator</code>) indicating the predator taxon (seven taxa in
total) and the remaining 19 columns indicating the number of individuals eaten
of each of the 19 potential prey taxa.
