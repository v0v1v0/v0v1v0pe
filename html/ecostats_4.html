<h2>Aphid data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A study of the effects of bird exclusion on biological control of aphids in oat and wheat fields in 
Germany (Grass <em>et al.</em> 2017). Many thanks to Ingo for providing the raw data.
In each of two fields (one of oats, one of wheat) there were eight plots, four with plastic netting 
to exclude birds, and four without. Aphid abundance was counted on seven different occasions over 
the first 38 weeks following netting. The expectation was that aphid numbers would decrease on bird 
exclusion, because an important food source to tree sparrows is aphid predators, hoverflies and 
ladybird beetles, so presence of birds may be limit the effectiveness of a biological control of aphids.

</dd>
<dt>Treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor indicating whether birds were excluded, <code>excluded</code> or <code>present</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of days since netting was applied.</p>
</dd>
<dt>counts</dt>
<dd>
<p>Aphid abundance (counts)</p>
</dd>
<dt>logcount</dt>
<dd>
<p>log(y+1)-transformed aphid abundance</p>
</dd>
