<h2>Goodreau's Faux Mesa High School as a network object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set (formerly called “fauxhigh”) represents a simulation of
an in-school friendship network.  The network is named <code>faux.mesa.high</code>
because the school commnunity on which it is based is in the rural western
US, with a student body that is largely Hispanic and Native American.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(faux.mesa.high)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>faux.mesa.high</code> is a <code>network</code> object
with 205 vertices (students, in this case) and 203 undirected edges (mutual
friendships).  To obtain additional summary information about it, type
<code>summary(faux.mesa.high)</code>.
</p>
<p>The vertex attributes are <code>Grade</code>, <code>Sex</code>, and <code>Race</code>. The
<code>Grade</code> attribute has values 7 through 12, indicating each student's
grade in school.  The <code>Race</code> attribute is based on the answers to two
questions, one on Hispanic identity and one on race, and takes six possible
values: White (non-Hisp.), Black (non-Hisp.), Hispanic, Asian (non-Hisp.),
Native American, and Other (non-Hisp.)

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data set is based upon a model fit to data from one school
community from the AddHealth Study, Wave I (Resnick et al., 1997). It was
constructed as follows:
</p>
<p>A vector representing the sex of each student in the school was randomly
re-ordered.  The same was done with the students' response to questions on
race and grade.  These three attribute vectors were permuted independently.
Missing values for each were randomly assigned with weights determined by
the size of the attribute classes in the school.
</p>
<p>The following <code>ergm()</code> specification was used to fit a model to the
original data:
</p>
<pre> ~ edges + nodefactor("Grade") + nodefactor("Race") +
nodefactor("Sex") + nodematch("Grade",diff=TRUE) +
nodematch("Race",diff=TRUE) + nodematch("Sex",diff=FALSE) +
gwdegree(1.0,fixed=TRUE) + gwesp(1.0,fixed=TRUE) + gwdsp(1.0,fixed=TRUE) </pre>
<p>The resulting model fit was then applied to a network with actors possessing
the permuted attributes and with the same number of edges as in the original
data.
</p>
<p>The processes for handling missing data and defining the race attribute are
described in Hunter, Goodreau &amp; Handcock (2008).
