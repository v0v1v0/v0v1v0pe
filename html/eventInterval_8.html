<h2>Calculate the intervals between events</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the intervals between a series of times, spreading
out equal times in one unit of time.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> get_intervals(event_times)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>event_times</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of times of occurrence of events.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>‘<span class="samp">⁠get_intervals⁠</span>’ calculates the intervals between the times passed
in ‘<span class="samp">⁠event_times⁠</span>’, adding increments to spread out times that are exactly
the same. This can be a problem when the times are integers, as in days. The
spreading out of events avoids zero intervals. The rationale for this is that
even if more than event occurred on the same day, it is extremely unlikely 
that the events occurred at exactly the same time of day. The best estimate
of the times of day is a uniform distribution over one day.
