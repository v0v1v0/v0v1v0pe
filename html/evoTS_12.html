<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function allows the users to test six variants of multivariate Unbiased Random Walk models. There are two options for the structure of the R matrix. A "diagonal" R matrix means the stochastic changes in the traits are assumed to be uncorrelated. A "symmetric" R matrix means the stochastic changes in the traits are assumed to be correlated, i.e. that they are non-independent.
</p>
<p>There are three options for the 'r' parameter. The "fixed" option means there is no change in the rate of change across time (r = 0). Setting r to "fixed" therefore fits a regular multivariate Unbiased Random Walk. The "decel" and "accel" options make the rate of change (the R matrix) decay (r &lt; 0) and increase (r &gt; 0) exponentially through time, respectively.
</p>
<p>The function searches - using an optimization routine - for the maximum-likelihood solution for the chosen multivariate Unbiased Random Walk model. The argument 'method' is passed to the 'optim' function and is included for the convenience of users to better control the optimization routine. The the default method (L-BFGS-B) seems to work for most evolutionary sequences.
</p>
<p>Initial estimates to start the optimization come from maximum-likelihood estimates of the univariate Unbiased Random Walk model (from the paleoTS package) fitted to each time-series separately.
</p>
<p>It is good practice to repeat any numerical optimization procedure from different starting points. This is especially important for complex models as the log-likelihood surface might contain more than one peak. The number of iterations is controlled by the argument 'iterations'. The function will report the model parameters from the iteration with the highest log-likelihood.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>First part of the output reports the log-likelihood of the model and its AICc score. The second part of the output is the maximum log-likelihood model parameters (ancestral.values, R). The last part of the output gives information about the number of parameters in the model (K), number of samples in the data (n) and number of times the optimization routine was run (iter).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The models have been implemented to be compatible with the joint parameterization routine in the package paleoTS. The optimization is therefore fit using the actual sample values, with the autocorrelation among samples accounted for in the log-likelihood function. The joint distribution of sample means is multivariate normal, with means and variance-covariances determined by evolutionary parameters and sampling errors.
