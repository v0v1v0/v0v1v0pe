<h2>Setting the mutation matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generation of the mutation matrix associated with the genome given as input.
A mutation matrix is used to simulate mutations that affect loci. An object
of the class <code>MutationMatrix</code> does not only contain a (genotypic)
mutation matrix. It also contains the attributes necessary for the
construction and easy-to-read display of this matrix.
The mutation matrix itself is a square matrix of size equal to the number of
genotypes. It is a probability matrix in that the sum of the values in
each row is equal to 1. For a given genotype, the row associated with it
describes the probabilistic proportions that lead by mutation of this
genotype to the production of the other genotypes (and of itself if there
are no mutations).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are three ways to define the mutation matrix associated with a
<code>Genome</code> class object.
</p>
<p>1) By giving two lists of allelic mutation matrices <code>mutHapLoci</code> and
<code>mutDipLoci</code>, for haploid and diploid loci respectively. Each of
these lists contains as many matrices as there are loci. These matrices
are transition matrices (squares, with the sum of the rows equal to 1)
of size equal to the number of alleles at the locus concerned.
</p>
<p>2) By giving a forward and a backward allelic mutation rate
(<code>forwardMut</code> and <code>backwardMut</code> respectively). The generated
mutation matrices will thus be defined with the same rates for all loci. A
forward mutation rate means that the transition from one allele to another
is done in the order in which they were defined when the Genome class object
was created, and in the other direction for the backward rate.
</p>
<p>3) By giving a list of <code>mutations</code> generated through the
mutation function.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">### Example with two loci, each with two alleles ###

# Definition of the genome
DL &lt;- list(dl = c("A", "a"))
HL &lt;- list(hl = c("B", "b"))
genomeObj &lt;- setGenome(listHapLoci = HL, listDipLoci = DL)

# Three ways to define the same mutation matrix associated with the
# genome defined above:

# 1) Mutation matrix from matrices
mutHapLoci &lt;- list(matrix(c(0.99, 0.01, 0.01, 0.99), 2))
mutDipLoci &lt;- list(matrix(c(0.99, 0.01, 0.01, 0.99), 2))
# One can then define the MutationMatrix class object:
setMutationMatrix(genomeObj,
  mutHapLoci = mutHapLoci,
  mutDipLoci = mutDipLoci
)

# 2) Mutation matrix from mutation rates
mutMatrixObj &lt;- setMutationMatrix(genomeObj, forwardMut = 0.1)
# or by adding a backward mutation rate:
mutMatrixObj &lt;- setMutationMatrix(genomeObj,
  forwardMut = 1e-3,
  backwardMut = 1e-4
)

# 3) Mutation matrix from single mutation definition
mutMatrixObj &lt;- setMutationMatrix(genomeObj,
  mutations = list(
    mutation(from = "A", to = "a", rate = 0.1),
    mutation(from = "B", to = "b", rate = 0.1)
  )
)
