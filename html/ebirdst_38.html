<h2>Load eBird Status Data Products raster data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Each of the eBird Status raster products is packaged as a GeoTIFF file
representing predictions on a regular grid. The core products are occurrence,
count, relative abundance, and proportion of population. This function loads
one of the available data products into R as a
SpatRaster object. Note that data must be download using
<code>ebirdst_download_status()</code> prior to loading it using this function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">load_raster(
  species,
  product = c("abundance", "count", "occurrence", "proportion-population"),
  period = c("weekly", "seasonal", "full-year"),
  metric = NULL,
  resolution = c("3km", "9km", "27km"),
  path = ebirdst_data_dir()
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>species</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; the species to load data for, given as a scientific
name, common name or six-letter species code (e.g. "woothr"). The full list
of valid species is in the ebirdst_runs data frame included in this
package. To download the example dataset, use <code>"yebsap-example"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>product</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; eBird Status raster product to load: occurrence,
count, relative abundance, or proportion of population. See Details for a
detailed explanation of each of these products.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>period</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; temporal period of the estimation. The eBird Status
models make predictions for each week of the year; however, as a
convenience, data are also provided summarized at the seasonal or annual
("full-year") level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>metric</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; by default, the weekly products provide estimates of
the median value (<code>metric = "median"</code>) and the summarized products are the
cell-wise mean across the weeks within the season (<code>metric = "mean"</code>).
However, additional variants exist for some of the products. For the weekly
relative abundance, confidence intervals are provided: specify <code>metric = "lower"</code> to get the 10th quantile or <code>metric = "upper"</code> to get the 90th
quantile. For the seasonal and annual products, the cell-wise maximum
values across weeks can be obtained with <code>metric = "max"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>resolution</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; the resolution of the raster data to load. The
default is to load the native 3 km resolution data; however, for some
applications 9 km or 27 km data may be suitable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; directory to download the data to. All downloaded
files will be placed in a sub-directory of this directory named for the
data version year, e.g. "2020" for the 2020 Status Data Products. Each
species' data package will then appear in a directory named with the eBird
species code. Defaults to a persistent data directory, which can be found
by calling <code>ebirdst_data_dir()</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The core eBird Status data products provide weekly estimates across
a regular spatial grid. They are packaged as rasters with 52 layers, each
corresponding to estimates for a week of the year, and we refer to them as
"cubes" (e.g. the "relative abundance cube"). All estimates are the median
expected value for a standard 2 km, 1 hour eBird Traveling Count by an
expert eBird observer at the optimal time of day and for optimal weather
conditions to observe the given species. These products are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>occurrence</code>: the expected probability (0-1) of occurrence of a species.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>count</code>: the expected count of a species, conditional on its occurrence at
the given location.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>abundance</code>: the expected relative abundance of a species, computed as the
product of the probability of occurrence and the count conditional on
occurrence.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>proportion-population</code>: the proportion of the total relative abundance
within each cell. This is a derived product calculated by dividing each cell
value in the relative abundance raster by the total abundance summed across
all cells.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these weekly data cubes, this function provides access to data
summarized over different periods. Seasonal cubes are produced by taking the
cell-wise mean or max across the weeks within each season. The boundary dates
for each season are species specific and are available in <code>ebirdst_runs</code>, and
if a season failed review no associated layer will be included in the cube.
In addition, full-year summaries provide the mean or max across all weeks of
the year that fall within a season that passed review. Note that this is not
necessarily all 52 weeks of the year. For example, if the estimates for the
non-breeding season failed expert review for a given species, the full-year
summary for that species will not include the weeks that would fall within
the non-breeding season.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For the weekly cubes, a SpatRaster with 52
layers for the given product, where the layer names are the dates
(<code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format) of the midpoint of each week. Seasonal cubes will
have up to four layers named with the corresponding season. The full-year
products will have a single layer.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# download example data if hasn't already been downloaded

# the weeks for each layer are stored in the layer names
names(abd_weekly)
# they can be converted to date objects with as.Date
