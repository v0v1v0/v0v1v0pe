<h3>Study setting and design</h3>

<p>Of 10,744 eyes with neovascular AMD receiving anti-VEGF therapy between
October 2008 and February 2020, 7802 eyes met study criteria
(treatment-naïve, first-treated eyes starting anti-VEGF therapy).
Institution:	 Moorfields Eye Clinic, London, UK
Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital
(ROAD17/031). The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki
</p>


<h3>Data source</h3>

<p>All clinical information at Moorfields Eye Hospital is recorded within an
electronic medical record (EMR) application (OpenEyes Foundation, London, UK).
A SQL database (SQL Server Reporting Service, Microsoft Corporation, Richmond, USA)
containing all the information from the EMR is in place and regular updates
are performed overnight to keep the data warehouse up-to-date.
VA is reported in ETDRS letter score (and categories for ETDRS &lt; 1).
The highest value (independent of measurement method)
available at each visit was chosen.
</p>


<h3>Data</h3>

<p>Types of data: de-identified human subjects data
Information governance authorised Moorfields Eye Clinic 19/07/2018.
