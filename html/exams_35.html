<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Usually, supplement files are created dynamically within an exercise,
e.g., data is simulated and then plotted or stored in a file etc.
However, sometimes an exercises wants to include a static supplement
file that is available in some directory on the system. Then,
the <code>include_supplement</code> is a convenience function that
copies such a file from its directory into the supplements of
an exercise. Then it can be included/referenced as usual in the
question/solution text.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## The "Rlogo" exercise uses a static image which is provided
## within the "exams" package.
if(interactive()) {
exams2html("Rlogo.Rnw")
}
</code></pre>
