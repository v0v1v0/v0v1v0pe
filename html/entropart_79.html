Entropy Partitioning to Measure Diversity
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to calculate alpha, beta and gamma diversity of communities, including phylogenetic and functional diversity.
</p>
<p>Estimation-bias corrections are available.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the entropart package, individuals of different "species" are counted in several "communities" which may (or not) be agregated to define a "metacommunity". In the metacommunity, the probability to find a species in the weighted average of probabilities in communities. This is a naming convention, which may correspond to plots in a forest inventory or any data organized the same way.
</p>
<p>Basic functions allow computing diversity of a community. Data is simply a vector of probabilities (summing up to 1) or of abundances (integer values that are numbers of individuals). Calculate entropy with functions such as <code>Tsallis</code>, <code>Shannon</code>, <code>Simpson</code>, <code>Hurlbert</code> or <code>GenSimpson</code> and explicit diversity (i.e. effective number of species) with <code>Diversity</code> and others. By default, the best available estimator of diversity will be used, according to the data.
</p>
<p>Communities can be simulated by <code>rCommunity</code>, explicitely declared as a species distribution (<code>as.AbdVector</code> or <code>as.ProbaVector</code>), and plotted.
</p>
<p>Phylogenetic entropy and diversity can be calculated if a phylogenetic (or functional), ultrametric tree is provided. See <code>PhyloEntropy</code>, <code>Rao</code> for examples of entropy and <code>PhyloDiversity</code> to calculate phylodiversity, with the state-of-the-art estimation-bias correction. Similarity-based diversity is calculated with <code>Dqz</code>, based on a similarity matrix.
</p>
<p>The simplest way to import data is to organize it into two text files. The first file should contain abundance data: the first column named <code>Species</code> for species names, and a column for each community.
</p>
<p>The second file should contain the community weights in two columns. The first one, named <code>Communities</code> should contain their names and the second one, named <code>Weights</code>, their weights.
</p>
<p>Files can be read and data imported by code such as:
</p>
<pre>
Abundances &lt;- read.csv(file="Abundances.csv", row.names = 1)
Weights &lt;- read.csv(file="Weights.csv")
MC &lt;- MetaCommunity(Abundances, Weights)
</pre>
<p>The last line of the code calls the <code>MetaCommunity</code> function to create an object that will be used by all metacommunity functions, such as <code>DivPart</code> (to partition diversity), <code>DivEst</code> (to partition diversity and calculate confidence interval of its estimation) or <code>DivProfile</code> (to compute diversity profiles).
