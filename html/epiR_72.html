Effective probability of disease
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the effective probability of disease (adjusted design prevalence) for each risk group within a population.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rsu.epinf(pstar, rr, ppr)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pstar</code></td>
<td>
<p>scalar, the design prevalence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rr</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector, defining the relative risk values for each strata in the population.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ppr</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of length <code>rr</code> defining the population proportions in each strata.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of comprised of two elements: 
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>epinf</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector listing the effective probability of infection listed in order of <code>rr</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>adj.risk</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector listing the adjusted risk values listed in order of <code>rr</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1:
## For a given disease of interest you believe that there is a 'high risk'
## and 'low risk' area in your country. The risk of disease in the high risk
## area compared with the low risk area is 5. A recent census shows that 
## 10% of the population are resident in the high risk area and 90% 
## are resident in the low risk area. You elect to set a design prevalence 
## of 0.10.

## Calculate the effective probability of infection for each area. 

rsu.epinf(pstar = 0.1, rr = c(5,1), ppr = c(0.10,0.90))

## The effective probabilities of infection for the high and low risk areas 
## are 0.36 and 0.07, respectively.


## EXAMPLE 2:
## Re-calculate the effective probabilities of infection assuming there are 
## 'high', 'medium' and 'low' risk areas. The risk of disease in the 
## medium risk area compared with the low risk area is 3. Population 
## proportions for each area are 0.10, 0.10 and 0.80, respectively.

rsu.epinf(pstar = 0.10, rr = c(5,3,1), ppr = c(0.10,0.10,0.80)) 
 
## The effective probabilities of infection for the high, medium and low 
## risk areas are 0.31, 0.19 and 0.06, respectively.
