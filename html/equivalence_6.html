<h2>Measured and simulated data from PREF, northern Idaho, USA, and 4-PG </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are the juxtaposition of model output and field measurements
for the Priest River Experimental Forest in northern Idaho, USA.  The
model was a process-based aspatial forest stand model called 4-PG,
developed from 3-PG by Duursma (2004). The data were used to demonstrate
a regression-based TOST in Robinson et al (2005). 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(pref.4PG)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataset with 35 observations on 33 variables, of which the
following two were used for the model validation exercise.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><kbd>stemvolinc</kbd></dt>
<dd>
<p>measured decadal stem growth in $m^3/ha$</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>volinc4PG</kbd></dt>
<dd>
<p>predicted decadal stem growth in $m^3/ha$</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p> Nothing in particular.  Devil's club (<em>Oplopanax horridus</em>)
is very painful.  
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data are documented in Duursma (2004) and Robinson et al (2005).
