<h2>
Clear coat thickness
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Measurements of film build from 40 test panels sprayed in a pilot
plant spray booth to study paint equipment set-up.  Target film build
was 65 microns.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 40 observations on the following variable.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>thickness</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>clear coat thickness (microns)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cars are coated (i.e., painted) in layers.  The “film build”
(i.e. thickness) of each layer of the coating has an effect on the
properties of the paint (performance and appearance) so it is
important to maintain the correct film builds. The final layer of
paint on a car is called the clear coat; the film build of this
layer was to be 65 microns.
