<h2>
Aluminum impurity amounts
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>As described in Nelson, Coffin and Copeland (2003),
“
Over a 2-hour period, twenty-five 200 gm samples were drawn at
random from a process that recycles plastic, and the amount of
aluminum impurities in the sample in ppm was determined for each
sample.
”
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 25 observations on the following variable.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ppm</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>amount of aluminum impurities (ppm)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
