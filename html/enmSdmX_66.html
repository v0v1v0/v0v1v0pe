<h2>Troubleshooting parallel operations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a guide to solving issues with running functions that can use more than one core. This includes the <code>train</code><em>XYZ</em> functions, <code>bioticVelocity</code>, and <code>predictEnmSdm</code>. Each of these function has the argument <code>cores</code>. By default, the value of <code>cores</code> is 1, so the function will use only one core. By setting this higher, you can use more cores on your machine.  However, occasionally you will run into the error:<br><code>Error in checkForRemoteErrors(lapply(cl, recvResult)) :</code><br><code>  2 nodes produced errors; first error: object '.doSnowGlobals' not found</code><br>
This means that the worker "nodes" (different instances of <code>R</code> started by the function to run in parallel) cannot find the <span class="pkg">doParallel</span> package, even if it is installed on your system.
</p>
<p>There are several solutions to this issue. One of them may work for you, and none are inherent to <span class="pkg">enmSdmX</span>, as far as I can tell.
</p>


<h3>Anti-virus is blocking R</h3>

<p>Strangely enough, running R in parallel sometimes looks like you are accessing the internet to anti-virus software. So, it may block access to other instances of R. You will have to do some surgery on your anti-virus software settings to find where to change this.
</p>


<h3>Your R packages are not stored in the "traditional" place</h3>

<p>R has a default directory where packages are stored on any system. If your packages are stored in a different place, worker nodes may not be able to find them <em>if</em> you use <code>setwd</code> to change the working directory. I do not know if you have to set the working directory back to the default for your system, or if you have to change it to the folder that <em>contains</em> the folder where your R packages reside (for me, they are the same directory). You can see what your current working directory is using <code>getwd</code>. RStudio will often change this directory automatically.
</p>
<p>So, if you get this error, try using <code>setwd</code> to set your working directory to the default one for your system, or to the folder that contains the folder that contains your packages.
</p>


<h3>Let me know</h3>

<p>I'm always game to help you track down your problems (with this package, not necessarily in general). The best way is to create an issue on <a href="https://github.com/adamlilith/enmSdmX/issues">GitHub</a>.
