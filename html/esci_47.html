<h2>Sleep Beauty - Ch11 - for End-of-Chapter Exercise 11.6</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Is there really such a thing as beauty sleep? To investigate, researchers
decided to examine the extent to which sleep relates to attractiveness. Each
of 70 college students self-reported the amount of sleep they had the night
before. In addition, a photograph was taken of each participant and rated for
attractiveness on a scale from 1 to 10 by two judges of the opposite gender.
The average rating score was used. You can download this data set (Sleep
Beauty) from the book website.
