<h2>Application of powder coating</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

 
<p>As described in Nelson, Coffin and Copeland (2003),
“The application of powder coating (a type of paint used on
appliances and, in limited settings, cars) is done by spraying the
material through a ‘gun’ that has an electrical charge on
it. There are three factors to consider in setting up the
application booth: the gun distance from the target item, the charge
and the pressure (flow rate) of the material through the gun. This
data set contains data from 18 runs.”
Note that there is no data for the high flow rate, high charges, and
low distance as these combinations were infeasible from an operations
standpoint (they were such that too much paint would be applied to the
target).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 18 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>distance</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>distance of the gun from the target (inches) - an
ordered factor with levels <code>11</code> &lt; <code>13</code> &lt; <code>15</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>charge</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>charge used (kvolts) - an ordered factor with
levels <code>35</code> &lt; <code>45</code> &lt; <code>55</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>flowrate</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>flow rate in gm/min. - an ordered factor with
levels <code>94</code> &lt; <code>124</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gloss</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a measure of the resulting gloss</p>
</dd>
</dl>
