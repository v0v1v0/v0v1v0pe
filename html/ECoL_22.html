<h2>Measures of overlapping</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Classification task. The overlapping measures evaluate how informative the 
available features are to separate the classes. If there is at least one very
discriminative feature in the dataset, the problem can be considered simpler 
than if there is no such an attribute.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">overlapping(...)

## Default S3 method:
overlapping(x, y, measures = "all",
  summary = c("mean", "sd"), ...)

## S3 method for class 'formula'
overlapping(formula, data, measures = "all",
  summary = c("mean", "sd"), ...)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following measures are allowed for this method:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>"F1"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum Fisher's Discriminant Ratio (F1) measures the overlap 
between the values of the features and takes the value of the largest 
discriminant ratio among all the available features.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"F1v"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Directional-vector maximum Fisher's discriminant ratio (F1v)
complements F1 by searching for a vector able to separate two classes 
after the training examples have been projected into it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"F2"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Volume of the overlapping region (F2) computes the overlap of 
the distributions of the features values within the classes. F2 can be 
determined by finding, for each feature its minimum and maximum values 
in the classes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"F3"</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum individual feature efficiency (F3) of each 
feature is given by the ratio between the number of examples that are 
not in the overlapping region of two classes and the total number of 
examples. This measure returns the maximum of the values found among 
the input features.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"F4"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Collective feature efficiency (F4) get an overview on how 
various features may work together in data separation. First the most 
discriminative feature according to F3 is selected and all examples that
can be separated by this feature are removed from the dataset. The 
previous step is repeated on the remaining dataset until all the 
features have been considered or no example remains. F4 returns the 
ratio of examples that have been discriminated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
