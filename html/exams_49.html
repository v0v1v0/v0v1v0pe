<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>exams2nops</code> is a convenience interface for <code>exams2pdf</code>
with a dynamically generated title page which can be printed,
scanned with <code>nops_scan</code> and evaluated automatically
by <code>nops_eval</code>. It is originally intended for
single- and multiple choice (schoice/mchoice) questions only but has also
some limited support for open-ended (string) questions.
</p>
<p>The exam sheet consists of various sections where information is either
printed our filled in by the students. The section with personal data is
just for human readers, it is not read automatically. The registration number
has to be filled in in digits and also marked with corresponding crosses
where only the latter is read automatically. The exam ID/type/scrambling
are printed directly into the PDF and read automatically after scanning.
Note that the font in the PDF must not be modified for the reading step
to work reliably. (A sans-serif font is used and hence the <code>sfmath</code>
LaTeX package is also used - if it is installed.) The questions can have
up to five alternatives which have to answered by the students. The crosses
are read automatically where both empty and completely filled boxes are
regarded as not crossed.

<p>Tutorial for NOPS workflow: <a href="https://www.R-exams.org/tutorials/exams2nops/">https://www.R-exams.org/tutorials/exams2nops/</a>.
</p>
<p>Limitations: (a) Only up to five answer alternatives per question are supported.
(b) Currently, only up to 45 questions are supported. If you have
more questions, consider splitting the entire exam up into two NOPS exams.
(c) Only up to 3 open-ended questions can be included. (d) Each question
must have the same number of answer alternatives and the same number of
points across random replications. For example, the <code>n</code> replications
drawn for the first exercise all need, say, five alternatives and two points.
Then, the second exercise may have, say, four alternatives and five points
and so on. But this may not be mixed within the same exercise number.
</p>
<p>The examples below show how PDF exams can be generated along with an RDS
file with (serialized) R data containing all meta-information about the exam.
The PDFs can be printed out for conducting the exam and the exam sheet
from the first page then needs to be scanned into PDF or PNG images. Then
the information from these scanned images can be read by <code>nops_scan</code>,
extracting information about the exam, the participants, and the corresponding
answers (as described above). The ZIP file produced by <code>nops_scan</code>
along with the RDS of the exam meta-information and a CSV file with participant
information can then be used by <code>nops_eval</code> to automatically evaluate
the whole exam and producing HTML reports for each participant. See
<code>nops_eval</code> for a worked example.
</p>
<p>Currently, up to three open-ended string questions can also be included.
These do not generate boxes on the first exam sheet but instead a second
exam sheet is produced for these open-ended questions. It is assumed that
a human reader reads these open-ended questions and then assigns points
by marking boxes on this separate sheet. Subsequently, this sheet can
also be read by <code>nops_scan</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>language</code> elements can be specified through a relatively simple
text file and the package already ships with:
English (<code>"en"</code>),
Croatian (<code>"hr"</code>),
Danish (<code>"da"</code>),
Dutch (<code>"nl"</code>),
Finnish (<code>"fi"</code>),
French (<code>"fr"</code>),
Galician (<code>"gl"</code>),
German (<code>"de"</code>),
Hungarian (<code>"hu"</code>),
Italian (<code>"it"</code>),
Japanese (<code>"ja"</code>),
Korean (<code>"ko"</code>),
Norwegian (Bokmål, <code>"no"</code>),
Portuguese (<code>"pt-PT"</code> or <code>"pt-BR"</code>; also <code>"pt"</code> is synonymous with <code>"pt-PT"</code>),
Romanian (<code>"ro"</code>),
Russian (<code>"ru"</code>),
Serbian (<code>"sr"</code>),
Slovak (<code>"sk"</code>),
Slovenian (<code>"sl"</code>),
Spanish (<code>"es"</code>),
Swiss German (<code>"gsw"</code>),
Turkish (<code>"tr"</code>),
Vietnamese (<code>"vi"</code>).
Note that the language names correspond to the ISO 639 codes
(<a href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php">https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php</a>)
or IETF language tags (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag</a>) if
no ISO 639 codes exists (as for Brazilian Portuguese).
