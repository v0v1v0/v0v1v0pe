<h2>Cohen's <em>U</em>s and Other Common Language Effect Sizes (CLES)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cohen's <code class="reqn">U_1</code>, <code class="reqn">U_2</code>, and <code class="reqn">U_3</code>, probability of superiority,
proportion of overlap, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds, and Vargha and Delaney's
<em>A</em> are CLESs. These are effect sizes that represent differences between two
(independent) distributions in probabilistic terms (See details). Pair with
any reported <code>stats::t.test()</code> or <code>stats::wilcox.test()</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These measures of effect size present group differences in probabilistic
terms:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Probability of superiority</strong> is the probability that, when sampling an
observation from each of the groups at random, that the observation from
the second group will be larger than the sample from the first group. For
the one-sample (or paired) case, it is the probability that the sample (or
difference) is larger than <em>mu</em>. (Vargha and Delaney's <em>A</em> is an alias for
the non-parametric <em>probability of superiority</em>.)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Cohen's <code class="reqn">U_1</code></strong> is the proportion of the total of both distributions
that does not overlap.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Cohen's <code class="reqn">U_2</code></strong> is the proportion of one of the groups that exceeds
<em>the same proportion</em> in the other group.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Cohen's <code class="reqn">U_3</code></strong> is the proportion of the second group that is smaller
than the median of the first group.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Overlap</strong> (OVL) is the proportional overlap between the distributions.
(When <code>parametric = FALSE</code>, <code>bayestestR::overlap()</code> is used.)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds are the <em>odds</em> of
non-parametric superiority (via <code>probs_to_odds()</code>), that is the odds that,
when sampling an observation from each of the groups at random, that the
observation from the second group will be larger than the sample from the
first group.
</p>
<p>Where <code class="reqn">U_1</code>, <code class="reqn">U_2</code>, and <em>Overlap</em> are agnostic to the direction of
the difference between the groups, <code class="reqn">U_3</code> and probability of superiority
are not.
</p>
<p>The parametric version of these effects assumes normality of both populations
and homoscedasticity. If those are not met, the non parametric versions
should be used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing the common language effect sizes (and
optionally their CIs).
</p>


<h3>Confidence (Compatibility) Intervals (CIs)</h3>

<p>For parametric CLES, the CIs are transformed CIs for Cohen's <em>d</em> (see
<code>d_to_u3()</code>). For non-parametric (<code>parametric = FALSE</code>) CLES, the CI of
<em>Pr(superiority)</em> is a transformed CI of the rank-biserial correlation
(<code>rb_to_p_superiority()</code>), while for all others, confidence intervals are
estimated using the bootstrap method (using the <code>{boot}</code> package).
</p>


<h3>CIs and Significance Tests</h3>

<p>"Confidence intervals on measures of effect size convey all the information
in a hypothesis test, and more." (Steiger, 2004). Confidence (compatibility)
intervals and p values are complementary summaries of parameter uncertainty
given the observed data. A dichotomous hypothesis test could be performed
with either a CI or a p value. The 100 (1 - <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>)% confidence
interval contains all of the parameter values for which <em>p</em> &gt; <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>
for the current data and model. For example, a 95% confidence interval
contains all of the values for which p &gt; .05.
<br><br>
Note that a confidence interval including 0 <em>does not</em> indicate that the null
(no effect) is true. Rather, it suggests that the observed data together with
the model and its assumptions combined do not provided clear evidence against
a parameter value of 0 (same as with any other value in the interval), with
the level of this evidence defined by the chosen <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> level (Rafi &amp;
Greenland, 2020; Schweder &amp; Hjort, 2016; Xie &amp; Singh, 2013). To infer no
effect, additional judgments about what parameter values are "close enough"
to 0 to be negligible are needed ("equivalence testing"; Bauer &amp; Kiesser,
1996).
</p>


<h3>Bootstrapped CIs</h3>

<p>Some effect sizes are directionless–they do have a minimum value that would
be interpreted as "no effect", but they cannot cross it. For example, a null
value of Kendall's W is 0, indicating no difference between
groups, but it can never have a negative value. Same goes for
U2 and Overlap: the null value of <code class="reqn">U_2</code> is
0.5, but it can never be smaller than 0.5; am <em>Overlap</em> of 1 means "full
overlap" (no difference), but it cannot be larger than 1.
<br><br>
When bootstrapping CIs for such effect sizes, the bounds of the CIs will
never cross (and often will never cover) the null. Therefore, these CIs
should not be used for statistical inference.
</p>


<h3>Plotting with <code>see</code>
</h3>

<p>The <code>see</code> package contains relevant plotting functions. See the <a href="https://easystats.github.io/see/articles/effectsize.html">plotting vignette in the <code>see</code> package</a>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If <code>mu</code> is not 0, the effect size represents the difference between the
first <em>shifted sample</em> (by <code>mu</code>) and the second sample.
