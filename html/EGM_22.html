<h2>Segmentation of electrical signal by wave specifications</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Segmentation of electrical signal by wave specifications
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">segmentation(
  object,
  by = "sinus",
  pad = "before",
  pad_length = 0L,
  center = NULL
)

segment_by_sinus(object)

pad_sequence(object, pad, pad_length)

center_sequence(object, center, pad_length)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>Object of the <code>egm</code> class, which includes header, signal
information, and annotation information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>character</code> string naming waveform type to segment by. Options
include the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p> sinus = Will call <code>segment_by_sinus()</code> on <code>egm</code> object
</p>
</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pad</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>character</code> String to specify which side of sequence to pad (or
both). Options include <code>c("before", "after", "both")</code>.
</p>
<p>Default is <em>before</em>. If <em>center</em> is being used, then the this argument is
ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pad_length</code></td>
<td>
<p>Offers padding of the segmented beats to a maximum length,
as an <code>integer</code>. The default is <em>0L</em>, which means no padding will be
applied. If <code>pad &gt; 0</code> then will add the baseline value (specified within
the header of the signal) to either before or after the signal. You can
also choose to <code>center</code> the sequence, which will also only occur if <code>pad &gt; 0</code>. I.e., if <code>pad = 500</code> then each segmented object will be increased TO a
max length of <code>500</code>. If the maximum size is larger than the padding size,
then a warning will be issued and the sequence will be truncated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>center</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single Roman alphabetic letter <code>character</code> that utilizes the
annotations given in the <code>egm</code> object to center the sequence. This is found
under the <strong>type</strong> variable in the annotation table.
</p>
<p>For example, if sinus waveforms were annotated as <code>c("P", "R", "T")</code> at
their peak, then could center around <em>R</em>. This will only occur if <code>pad &gt; 0L</code>. This is case-insensitive. The amount of padding will be determined by
the <strong>pad_length</strong> argument</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Requires a 12-lead ECG that has been digitized, and input as an
<code>egm</code> object. This object must have an annotation file associated with it
that contains demarcation annotations. Please see below for approaches based
on the annotation type. Current, the following are supported:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p> sinus = supports using <em>ecgpuwave</em> as the annotator
</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list of <code>egm</code> objects. Each item is a segmentation of an
<code>egm</code>, using the selected channels (if available). It will attempt to
optimize and pick the best annotations to help create consistencies between
the signal channels as possible.
</p>


<h3>Sinus beat segmentation</h3>

<p>Identify individual sinus beats on surface ECG and extract as individual
beats, returning a list of sinus beats in the form of the <code>egm</code> class. a
consistent <strong>P</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>T</strong> wave amongst all channels. If a channel
does not have, for example, a visible <strong>T</strong> wave, it will still label it as
information gained from other channels. This is based off of the algorithm
from the annotation tool named <code>ecgpuwave</code>. Please see <code>read_annotation()</code>
for further details.
