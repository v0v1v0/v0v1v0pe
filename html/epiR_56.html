<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Consider a clinical trial comparing two groups, a standard treatment (<code class="reqn">s</code>) and a new treatment (<code class="reqn">n</code>). In each group, the mean of the outcome of interest for subjects receiving the standard treatment is <code class="reqn">N_{s}</code> and the mean of the outcome of interest for subjects receiving the new treatment is <code class="reqn">N_{n}</code>. We specify the absolute value of the maximum acceptable difference between <code class="reqn">N_{n}</code> and <code class="reqn">N_{s}</code> as <code class="reqn">\delta</code>.
</p>
<p>In an equality trial we test the hypothesis that the means of two (treatment, control) groups are different. For an equality trial the null hypothesis is:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">H_{0}: |N_{s} - N_{n}| = 0</code> 
</p>
<p>and the alternative hypothesis is:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">H_{1}: |N_{s} - N_{n}| \neq 0</code>
</p>
<p>In an equivalence trial we test the hypothesis that the means of two (treatment, control) groups are not too different, where clinical criteria are used to define 'not too different' (<code>delta</code>). For an equivalence trial the null hypothesis is:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">H_{0}: |N_{s} - N_{n}| \ge \delta</code> 
</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">H_{1}: |N_{s} - N_{n}| &lt; \delta</code>
</p>
<p>An equality trial is used when you want to confirm that the numeric value of the outcome for treatment and control groups differ. An equivalence trial is used when you want to prove that the clinical outcome for treatment and control groups are the same. In bioequivalence trials, a 90% confidence interval is often used. The value of the maximum acceptable difference <code class="reqn">\delta</code> is chosen so that a patient will not detect any change in effect when replacing the standard treatment with the new treatment.
</p>
<p>Note that when:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">sign(P_n - P_s - \delta) \neq sign(z_{1-\alpha} + z_{1-\beta})</code>
</p>

<p>there is no solution for study power. For typical values of <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> and <code class="reqn">\beta</code> this would occur if <code class="reqn">P_{n} - P_{s} - \delta &lt; 0</code>. That is, when the targeted alternative is within the null hypothesis. The function issues a warning if these conditions are met.
</p>
<p>When calculating the power of a study, the argument <code>n</code> refers to the total study size (that is, the number of subjects in the treatment group plus the number in the control group).
</p>
<p>For a comparison of the key features of superiority, equivalence and non-inferiority trials, refer to the documentation for <code>epi.ssequb</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1 (from Machin, Campbell, Tan and Tan 2009 p. 113):
## It is anticipated that patients on a particular drug have a mean diastolic 
## blood pressure of 96 mmHg, as against 94 mmHg on an alternative. It is also 
## anticipated that the standard deviation of diastolic BP is approximately 
## 8 mmHg. If one wishes to confirm that the difference is likely to be less 
## than 5 mmHg, that is, one wishes to show equivalence, how many patients 
## are needed to be enrolled in the trial? Assume 80% power and 
## 95% significance.

epi.ssequc(treat = 94, control = 96, sigma = 8, delta = 5, n = NA, 
   power = 0.80, r = 1, type = "equivalence", nfractional = FALSE, 
   alpha = 0.05)

## A total of 244 subjects need to be enrolled in the trial, 122 in the 
## treatment group and 122 in the control group.


## EXAMPLE 2 (from Chow S, Shao J, Wang H 2008, p. 64):
## A pharmaceutical company is interested in conducting a clinical trial
## to compare two cholesterol lowering agents for treatment of patients with
## congestive heart disease using a parallel design. The primary efficacy 
## parameter is the LDL. In what follows, we will consider the situation
## where the intended trial is for testing equivalence of mean responses 
## in LDL. Assume that 80% power is required at a 5% level of significance.

## In this example, we assume a 5 unit (i.e., delta = 5) change of LDL is 
## considered of clinically meaningful difference. Assume the standard 
## of LDL is 10 units and the LDL concentration in the treatment group is 20 
## units and the LDL concentration in the control group is 21 units.

epi.ssequc(treat = 20, control = 21, sigma = 10, delta = 5, n = NA, 
   power = 0.80, r = 1, type = "equivalence", nfractional = FALSE, 
   alpha = 0.05)

## A total of 216 subjects need to be enrolled in the trial, 108 in the 
## treatment group and 108 in the control group.


## EXAMPLE 2 (cont.):
## Suppose only 150 subjects were enrolled in the trial, 75 in the treatment
## group and 75 in the control group. What is the estimated study power?

epi.ssequc(treat = 20, control = 21, sigma = 10, delta = 5, n = 150, 
   power = NA, r = 1, type = "equivalence", nfractional = FALSE, 
   alpha = 0.05)

## With only 150 subjects enrolled the estimated study power is 0.58.


## EXAMPLE 3:
## A study is to be carried out to determine if the daily weight gain of calves 
## (in kilograms) on two diets differ. The null hypothesis is that there is 
## no difference in daily weight gain. The alternative hypothesis is that 
## daily weight gains for the two groups differ. How many calves need to 
## be enrolled into a study to detect a statistically significant difference
## in daily weight gain for the two groups? Assume daily weight gain for the 
## treatment group is 0.70 kg per day and daily weight gain for the control
## group is 0.65 kg per day and the standard deviation of daily weight gain in
## calves of this age is 0.06. Assume power of 0.80 and alpha of 0.05.

epi.ssequc(treat = 0.70, control = 0.65, sigma = 0.06, delta = NA, n = NA, 
   power = 0.80, r = 1, type = "equality", nfractional = FALSE, 
   alpha = 0.05)

## A total of 48 calves need to be enrolled into the study: 24 in the treatment
## group and 24 in the control group.
