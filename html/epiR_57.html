<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Consider a clinical trial comparing two groups, a standard treatment (<code class="reqn">s</code>) and a new treatment (<code class="reqn">n</code>). A proportion of subjects in the standard treatment group experience the outcome of interest <code class="reqn">P_{s}</code> and a proportion of subjects in the new treatment group experience the outcome of interest <code class="reqn">P_{n}</code>. We specify the absolute value of the maximum acceptable difference between <code class="reqn">P_{n}</code> and <code class="reqn">P_{s}</code> as <code class="reqn">\delta</code>. For a non-inferiority trial the value entered for <code>delta</code> must be greater than or equal to zero.
</p>
<p>For a non-inferiority trial the null hypothesis is:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">H_{0}: P_{s} - P_{n} \ge \delta</code> 
</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">H_{1}: P_{s} - P_{n} &lt; \delta</code>
</p>
<p>The aim of a non-inferiority trial is show that a new treatment is not (much) inferior to a standard treatment. Showing non-inferiority can be of interest because: (a) it is often not ethically possible to do a placebo-controlled trial; (b) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints, but is safer; (c) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints, but is cheaper to produce or easier to administer; and (d) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints in clinical trial, but compliance will be better outside the clinical trial and hence efficacy better outside the trial.
</p>
<p>When calculating the power of a study, note that the argument <code>n</code> refers to the total study size (that is, the number of subjects in the treatment group plus the number in the control group).
</p>
<p>For a comparison of the key features of superiority, equivalence and non-inferiority trials, refer to the documentation for <code>epi.ssequb</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## EXAMPLE 1 (from Chow S, Shao J, Wang H 2008, p. 90):
## A pharmaceutical company would like to conduct a clinical trial to
## compare the efficacy of two antimicrobial agents when administered orally 
## to patients with skin infections. Assume the true mean cure rate of the 
## treatment is 0.85 and the true mean cure rate of the control is 0.65. 
## We consider the proportion cured in the treatment group minus the proportion 
## cured in the control group (i.e., delta) of 0.10 or less to be of no clinical 
## significance.

## Assuming a one-sided test size of 5% and a power of 80% how many 
## subjects should be included in the trial?

epi.ssninfb(treat = 0.85, control = 0.65, delta = 0.10, n = NA, power = 0.80, 
   r = 1, nfractional = FALSE, alpha = 0.05)

## A total of 50 subjects need to be enrolled in the trial, 25 in the 
## treatment group and 25 in the control group.


## EXAMPLE 1 (cont.):
## Suppose only 40 subjects were enrolled in the trial, 20 in the treatment
## group and 20 in the control group. What is the estimated study power?

epi.ssninfb(treat = 0.85, control = 0.65, delta = 0.10, n = 40, power = NA, 
   r = 1, nfractional = FALSE, alpha = 0.05)

## With only 40 subjects the estimated study power is 0.73.


## EXAMPLE 2:
## Assume the true mean cure rate for a treatment group to be 0.40 and the true
## mean cure rate for a control group to be the same, 0.40. We consider a 
## difference of 0.10 in cured proportions (i.e., delta = 0.10) to be of no 
## clinical importance.

## Assuming a one-sided test size of 5% and a power of 30% how many 
## subjects should be included in the trial?

n &lt;- epi.ssninfb(treat = 0.4, control = 0.4, delta = 0.10, n = NA, power = 0.3, 
   r = 1, nfractional = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)$n.total
n

## A total of 120 subjects need to be enrolled in the trial, 60 in the 
## treatment group and 60 in the control group.

## Re-run the function using n = 120 to confirm that power equals 0.30:

epi.ssninfb(treat = 0.4, control = 0.4, delta = 0.10, n = n, power = NA, 
   r = 1, nfractional = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)$power

## With 120 subjects the estimated study power is 0.30.
