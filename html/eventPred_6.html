<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the time-decay model, the mean function is
<code>mu(t) = mu/delta*(t - 1/delta*(1 - exp(-delta*t)))</code>
and the rate function is
<code>lambda(t) = mu/delta*(1 - exp(-delta*t))</code>.
For the B-spline model, the daily enrollment rate is approximated as
<code>lambda(t) = exp(B(t)*theta)</code>,
where <code>B(t)</code> represents the B-spline basis functions.
</p>
<p>The <code>enroll_prior</code> variable should be a list that
includes <code>model</code> to specify the enrollment model
(poisson, time-decay, or piecewise poisson),
<code>theta</code> and <code>vtheta</code> to indicate the parameter
values and the covariance matrix. One can use a very small
value of <code>vtheta</code> to fix the parameter values.
For the piecewise Poisson enrollment model, the list
should also include <code>accrualTime</code>. It should be noted
that the B-spline model is not appropriate for use as prior.
</p>
<p>For event prediction by treatment with prior information,
the <code>event_prior</code> (<code>dropout_prior</code>) variable should be
a list with one element per treatment. For each treatment, the
element should include <code>model</code> to specify the event (dropout)
model (exponential, weibull, log-logistic, log-normal,
or piecewise exponential), <code>theta</code> and <code>vtheta</code> to
indicate the parameter values and the covariance matrix.
For the piecewise exponential event (dropout) model, the list
should also include <code>piecewiseSurvivalTime</code>
(<code>piecewiseDropoutTime</code>) to indicate the location of knots.
It should be noted that the model averaging and spline options
are not appropriate for use as prior.
</p>
<p>If the event prediction is not by treatment while the prior
information is given by treatment, then each element of
<code>event_prior</code> (<code>dropout_prior</code>) should also include
<code>w</code> to specify the weight of the treatment in a
randomization block. If the prediction is not by treatment and
the prior is given for the overall study, then <code>event_prior</code>
(<code>dropout_prior</code>) is a flat list with <code>model</code>,
<code>theta</code>, and <code>vtheta</code>. For the piecewise exponential
event (dropout) model, it should also include
<code>piecewiseSurvivalTime</code> (<code>piecewiseDropoutTime</code>) to
indicate the location of knots.
</p>
<p>For analysis-stage enrollment and event prediction, the
<code>enroll_prior</code>, <code>event_prior</code>, and
<code>dropout_prior</code> are either set to <code>NULL</code> to
use the observed data only, or specify the prior distribution
of model parameters to be combined with observed data likelihood
for enhanced modeling flexibility.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list that includes the fits of observed data models,
as well as simulated enrollment data for new subjects and
simulated event data for ongoing and new subjects.
