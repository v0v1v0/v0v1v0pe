<h2>
Fit an Age-Period-Cohort model to tabular data.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits the classical five models to tabulated rate data (cases,
person-years) classified by two of age, period, cohort:
Age, Age-drift, Age-Period, Age-Cohort and Age-Period-Cohort. There are no
assumptions about the age, period or cohort classes being of the same
length, or that tabulation should be only by two of the variables.
Only requires that mean age and period for each tabulation unit is given.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">apc.fit( data,
            A,
            P,
            D,
            Y,
        ref.c,
        ref.p,
          dist = c("poisson","binomial"),
         model = c("ns","bs","ls","factor"),
       dr.extr = "Y",
          parm = c("ACP","APC","AdCP","AdPC","Ad-P-C","Ad-C-P","AC-P","AP-C"),
          npar = c( A=5, P=5, C=5 ),
         scale = 1,
         alpha = 0.05,
     print.AOV = TRUE )

<p>Reference cohort, numerical. Defaults to median date of

<p>Distribution (or more precisely: Likelihood) used for modeling.
if a binomial model us used, <code>Y</code> is assumed to be the
denominator; <code>"binomial"</code> gives a binomial model with logit
link. The Age-effects returned are converted to the
probability scale, Period and Cohort effects are still odds-ratios.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dr.extr</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character or numeric.	
How the drift parameter should be extracted from the
age-period-cohort model. Specifies the inner product used for
definition of orthogonality of the period / cohort effects to the
linear effects â€” in terms of a diagonal matrix.
</p>
<p><code>"Y"</code> (default) uses the no. person-time, <code>Y</code>,
corresponding to the observed information about the square root of
the rate.
</p>
<p><code>"R"</code> or <code>"L"</code> uses <code>Y*Y/D</code> corresponding to the
observed information about the rate (usually termed "lambda", hence
the "<code>L</code>"). 
</p>
<p><code>"D"</code> or <code>"T"</code> uses the no. events as the weight in the
inner product, corresponding to the information about the log-rate
(usually termed "theta", hence the "<code>T</code>").
</p>
<p>If given <code>"n"</code> (naive) (well, in fact any other character value) will
induce the use of the standard inner product putting equal weight on
all units in the dataset.
</p>
<p>If <code>dr.extr</code> is a numeric vector this is used as the diagonal
of the matrix inducing the inner product. 
</p>
<p>If <code>dr.extr</code> is a numeric scalar, <code>D + dr.extr*Y</code> is used
as the diagonal of the matrix inducing the inner product. This
family of inner products are the only ones that meet the
split-observation invariance criterion.
</p>
<p>The setting of this parameter has no effect on the fit of the model,
it only influences the parametrization returned in the <code>Age</code>,
<code>Per</code> and <code>Coh</code> elements of the resulting list.

<p>Character. Indicates the parametrization of the effects.
The first four refer to the ML-fit of the Age-Period-Cohort model,
the last four give Age-effects from a smaller model and residuals
relative to this. If one of the latter is chosen, the argument
<code>dr.extr</code> is ignored. Possible values for <code>parm</code> are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"ACP"</code>: ML-estimates. Age-effects as rates for the
reference cohort. Cohort effects as RR relative to the reference
cohort. Period effects constrained to be 0 on average with 0 slope.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"APC"</code>: ML-estimates. Age-effects as rates for the
reference period. Period effects as RR relative to the reference
period. Cohort effects constrained to be 0 on average with 0 slope.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"AdCP"</code>: ML-estimates. Age-effects as rates for the
reference cohort. Cohort and period effects constrained to be 0 on
average with 0 slope. In this case returned effects do not
multiply to the fitted rates, the drift is missing and needs to be
included to produce the fitted values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"AdPC"</code>: ML-estimates. Age-effects as rates for the
reference period. Cohort and period effects constrained to be 0 on
average with 0 slope. In this case returned effects do not
multiply to the fitted rates, the drift is missing and needs to be
included to produce the fitted values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"Ad-C-P"</code>: Age effects are rates for the reference
cohort in the Age-drift model (cohort drift). Cohort effects are from the model
with cohort alone, using log(fitted values) from the Age-drift
model as offset. Period effects are from the model with period
alone using log(fitted values) from the cohort model as offset.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"Ad-P-C"</code>: Age effects are rates for the reference
period in the Age-drift model (period drift). Period effects are from the model
with period alone, using log(fitted values) from the Age-drift
model as offset. Cohort effects are from the model with cohort
alone using log(fitted values) from the period model as offset.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"AC-P"</code>: Age effects are rates for the reference
cohort in the Age-Cohort model, cohort effects are RR relative to
the reference cohort. Period effects are from the model
with period alone, using log(fitted values) from the Age-Cohort
model as offset.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"AP-C"</code>: Age effects are rates for the reference
period in the Age-Period model, period effects are RR relative to
the reference period. Cohort effects are from the model
with cohort alone, using log(fitted values) from the Age-Period
model as offset.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each record in the input data frame represents a subset of a Lexis
diagram. The subsets need not be of equal length on the age and
period axes, in fact there are no restrictions on the shape of
these; they could be Lexis triangles for example. The requirement is
that <code>A</code> and <code>P</code> are coded with the mean age and calendar
time of observation in the subset. This is essential since <code>A</code>
and <code>P</code> are used as quantitative variables in the models.
</p>
<p>This approach is different from to the vast majority of the uses of
APC-models in the literature where a factor model is used for age,
period and cohort effects. The latter can be obtained by using
<code>model="factor"</code>. Note however that the cohort factor is defined
from <code>A</code> and <code>P</code>, so that it is not possible in this
framework to replicate the Boyle-Robertson fallacy.
