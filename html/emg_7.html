<h2>PC9 cancer cell observations with 3 micro-molar erlotinib at time 0.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>PC9 cancer cell observations with 3um erlotinib applied at time 0. Experiment was performed on 2011/9/9 (F07) in the Vito Quaranta laboratory at Vanderbilt University Cancer Biology Center by Darren Tyson. Cells were tracked by nuclear labeling with histone H2B and imaged on a BD Pathway 855 for several days. All numerical values are in hours. Funding was provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
</p>
<p>This data set was specifically chosen to give the emg.mle function something difficult to work on.
