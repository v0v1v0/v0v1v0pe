<h2>Problem: Comparison between several Machine Learning algorithms from the Weka library</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A problem containing experimental data obtaining by comparing several instances
of Machine Algorithms from the Weka library. The variables are as follows:
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(wekaExperiment)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> method. Classification algorithms used in the experimen (NaiveBayes, J48, IBk)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> problem. Problems used as benchmark in the comparison, up to 12.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> featureSelection. Boolean parameter indicating if the data was preprocessed
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> fold. For each configuration a 10-fold cross validation was performed. This variable is a numeric value ranging from 1 to 10.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> accuracy. This is a measure of the performance of each algorithm. Representing the percentage of correctly classified instances.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> trainingTime. A second measure of performance. This one indicates the time in seconds that took the algorithm to build the model.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
