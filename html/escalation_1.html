<h2>The 'escalation' package.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>escalation provides methods for working with dose-finding clinical trials.
We provide implementations of many dose-finding clinical trial designs,
ncluding the continual reassessment method (CRM) by O'Quigley et al. (1990)
&lt;doi:10.2307/2531628&gt;, the toxicity probability interval (TPI) design by Ji
et al. (2007) &lt;doi:10.1177/1740774507079442&gt;, the modified TPI (mTPI) design
by Ji et al. (2010) &lt;doi:10.1177/1740774510382799&gt;, the Bayesian optimal
interval design (BOIN) by Liu &amp; Yuan (2015) &lt;doi:10.1111/rssc.12089&gt;, EffTox
by Thall &amp; Cook (2004) &lt;doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00218.x&gt;; the design of
Wages &amp; Tait (2015) &lt;doi:10.1080/10543406.2014.920873&gt;, and the 3+3
described by Korn et al. (1994) &lt;doi:10.1002/sim.4780131802&gt;. All designs
are implemented with a common interface. We also offer optional additional
classes to tailor the behaviour of all designs, including avoiding skipping
doses, stopping after n patients have been treated at the recommended dose,
stopping when a toxicity condition is met, or demanding that n patients are
treated before stopping is allowed. By daisy-chaining together these classes
using the pipe operator from 'magrittr', it is simple to tailor the
behaviour of a dose-finding design so it behaves how the trialist wants.
Having provided a flexible interface for specifying designs, we then provide
functions to run simulations and calculate dose-paths for future cohorts of
patients.
