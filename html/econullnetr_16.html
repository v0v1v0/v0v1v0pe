<h2>'Forbidden' links to accompany the upland streams food web</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A table specifying trophic links that are allowed when modelling part of the
food web from upland Welsh stream containing the two macroinvetebrate
predators <em>Rhyacophila dorsalis</em> and <em>Dinocras cephalotes</em>
(see <code>WelshStreams</code>).  There is one forbidden link for each
predator species, preventing cannibalism from being included in the null
model: this is because the method used to screen predator gut contents for
prey (next generation sequencing) cannot distinguish between predator and
prey of the same species.  Both predators are generalists, so all other
trophic links are permitted.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">WelshStreams.fl
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2 rows and 17 columns, each row representing one of the
two predator genera. The first column (<code>Predator</code>) indicates the predator
genus, whilst columns 2â€“17 indicate which of the 16 potential prey taxa can be
consumed (1) or are forbidden (0).
