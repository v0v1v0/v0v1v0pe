<h2>Toolbox for Error-Driven Learning Simulations with Two-Layer Networks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package 'edl' provides a set of functions that facilitate 
the evaluation, interpretation, and visualization of small error-driven 
learning simulations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Error-driven learning is based on the Widrow &amp; Hoff (1960) learning 
rule and the Rescorla-Wagner's learning 
equations (Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972), which are also at the core of 
Naive Discrimination Learning (Baayen et al, 2011). Error-driven can 
be used to explain bottom-up human learning 
(Hoppe et al, under revision), but is also at the 
core of artificial neural networks applications in the form of the 
Delta rule. 
This package provides a set of functions for building 
small-scale simulations to investigate the dynamics of error-driven 
learning and it's interaction with the structure of the input. For 
modeling error-driven learning using the Rescorla-Wagner equations 
the package 'ndl' (Baayen et al, 2011) is available on CRAN at 
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ndl">https://cran.r-project.org/package=ndl</a>. However, the package 
currently only allows tracing of a cue-outcome combination, rather 
than returning the learned networks.  
To fill this gap, we implemented a new package with 
a few functions that facilitate inspection of the networks for small 
error driven learning simulations. Note that our functions are not 
optimized for training large data sets (no parallel processing), as 
they are intended for small scale simulations and course examples. 
(Consider the python implementation <code>pyndl</code> 
<a href="https://pyndl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://pyndl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a> for that purpose.)
