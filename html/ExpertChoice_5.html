<h2>Fractional Factorial Design Efficiency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fractional Factorial Design Efficiency
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fractional_factorial_efficiency(formula, searched_fractional_factorial)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A specification, in formula form, of the desired effects sought to be estimated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>searched_fractional_factorial</code></td>
<td>
<p>a fractional factorial generated as the result of a 'search_design'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with the following objects:
1. X - This is the formula expanded version of the fractional factorial which was passed to the function.
2. information_mat - This is the information matrix described by the associated note. Note: it is rounded to three decimal places to ease reading.
3. inv_information_mat - This is the inverse of the information matrix. Note: it is rounded to three decimal places to ease reading.
4. lamda_mat - This is the diagonal elements of the Lamda Matrix described by Kuhfeld (pg. 62). The elements are the eigen values of the inv_information_mat.
5. inv_diag - This is the diagonal elements of the inv_information_mat. (May be of use to some researchers...)
6. GWLP - This is the generalised world lengths for the searched design. (Note: this would not change depending on what is in the formula expansion.)
7. A_eff - This is the A-efficiency of the design given the particular formula expansion.
8. D_eff - This is the D-efficiency of the design given the particular formula expansion.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># See step 5 of the Practical Introduction to ExpertChoice vignette.

# Step 1
attrshort  = list(condition = c("0", "1", "2"),
technical =c("0", "1", "2"),
provenance = c("0", "1"))

#Step 2
# ff stands for "full fatorial"
 ff  &lt;-  full_factorial(attrshort)
 af  &lt;-  augment_levels(ff)
# af stands for "augmented factorial"

# Step 3
# Choose a design type: Federov or Orthogonal. Here an Orthogonal one is used.
nlevels &lt;- unlist(purrr::map(ff, function(x){length(levels(x))}))
fractional_factorial &lt;- DoE.base::oa.design(nlevels = nlevels, columns = "min34")

# Step 4
# The functional draws out the rows from the original augmented full factorial design.
colnames(fractional_factorial) &lt;- colnames(ff)
fractional &lt;- search_design(ff, fractional_factorial)

# Step 5! - The fractional_factorial_efficiency function
# The formula requires reference to the original attributes of the design.
# Check for the main effects.
fractional_factorial_efficiency(~ condition + technical + provenance, fractional)
# Check for the main effects with some interaction.
fractional_factorial_efficiency(~ condition + technical * provenance, fractional)
