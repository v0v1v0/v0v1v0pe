<h2>Functions that Compute Error Levels Given Audit Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the error amounts for all precincts in Z that were audited from
the audit data, given as overstatement errors for all candidates.
</p>
<p>compute.audit.errors uses the calc functions and the weight functions in a
1-2 combination.
</p>
<p>calc.pairwise.e\_p() is often used with an err.override for simulation
studies and whatnot to see what a fixed vote impact would have on taints for
trinomial.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calc.overstatement.e_p(Z)

calc.pairwise.e_p(Z, audit = NULL, err.override = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Z</code></td>
<td>
<p>elec.data object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>audit</code></td>
<td>
<p>The audit object, if it is not in the Z object, or if some
other object other than the one in the Z object is desired to be considered
as the audit object.  Used by the simulation functions to generate errors
for some fixed amount of error in conjunction with the err.override.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>err.override</code></td>
<td>
<p>Assume a baserate of this amount of error everywhere,
ignoring audit data. If non-null, use this as the found error in votes
rather than the actual errors found in the audit.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>compute.audit.errors returns a new audit table from Z with two new
columns, err and err.weighted, corresponding to the errors found in each
audited precinct before and after the weight function has been applied to
them.
</p>
<p>calc.overstatement.e_p: Vector (of length of audited precincts) of found errors by precinct.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Z must have an audit component, or one must be passed, for this
function to make sense!  Remember that audit objects have overstatements,
NOT total votes for candidates.  With err.override being set this is less
relevant as the actual votes are usually ignored.
