<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains a subset of the publicly available data from Chetty and
Hendren (2018). It contains raw estimates and standard errors of neighborhood
effects at the commuting zone level
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cz

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 741 rows corresponding to commuting zones (CZ) and
10 columns corresponding to the variables:
</p>

<dd>
<p>Fixed-effect estimate of the causal effect of living in the CZ
for one year on children's percentile rank in the national distribution of
household earnings at age 26 relative to others in the same birth cohort for
children growing up with parents at the 25th percentile of national income
distribution</p>
