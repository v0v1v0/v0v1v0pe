<h2>ectotemp: Quantitative Estimates of Small Ectotherm Temperature Regulation Effectiveness</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Easy and rapid quantitative estimation of small terrestrial ectotherm temperature regulation effectiveness in R. ectotemp is built on classical formulas that evaluate temperature regulation by means of various indices, inaugurated by Hertz et al. (1993) &lt;doi: 10.1086/285573&gt;. Options for bootstrapping and permutation testing are included to test hypotheses about divergence between organisms, species or populations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ectotemp builds on work by Hertz et al. (1993, and references therein),
Christian and Weavers (1996), and Blouin-Demers and Weatherhead (2001). Users
of this package do not need to be particularly experienced in R, but are
expected to be familiar with the background, appropriate choice, and caveats
of the available functions (Hertz et al. 1993, Christian and Weavers 1996,
Wills and Beaupre 2000, Blouin-Demers and Nadeau 2005).
<br><br>
The aim of the ectotemp package is to facilitate easy and rapid estimation
of small, terrestrial ectotherm temperature regulation effectiveness after
data describing field-active body temperatures (<em>T</em>b), environmental
(operative) temperatures (<em>T</em>e) and preferred temperatures (the set-
point range, <em>T</em>set) have been collected. The package provides functions
for the following types of analyses:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The <b>accuracy of temperature regulation (<em>d</em>b)</b> and
associated descriptive statistics, which estimate the degree to which
ectotherms experience body temperature outside of their set-point range;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <b>thermal quality of the habitat (<em>d</em>e)</b> and associated
descriptive statistics, which estimate the degree to which environmental
temperature matches the set-point range;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Choice between several approaches to <b>calculate effectiveness of
temperature regulation (<em>E</em>)</b>, including bootstrap resampling of the
original distributions of Tb and Te to determine confidence interval for
the mean, and permutation tests for between-population or species
comparisons;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Exploitation of the thermal environment (Ex)</b>, i.e., the amount
of time when field body temperatures (<em>T</em>b) are within the set-point
range, relative to the total amount of time during which this could have
been possible as indicated by operative temperatures (<em>T</em>e).

</li>
</ul>
