<h2>
Curl of transparencies
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The current formulation of a coating on transparencies used in ink-jet
printers causes them to curl.  These data are from experiments
conducted on a new formulation of the coating to reduce the amount of curl.  
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 12 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>catalyst</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>amount of catalyst</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>compa</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>amount of component a (the second component)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>curl</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a measure of the curl</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data were collected when transparencies were still widely used
for presentations.  With the proliferation of projectors, transparencies
are being used less and less.  However, coatings on paper will continue
to be an area of research as coatings have to interact with a variety
of printers and inks in order to be useful.
