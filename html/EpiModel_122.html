<h2>Disease Status Initialization Module for netsim</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function sets the initial disease status on the
network given the specified initial conditions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">init_status.net(dat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p>Main <code>netsim_dat</code> object containing a <code>networkDynamic</code>
object and other initialization information passed from
<code>netsim</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This internal function sets, either randomly or deterministically, the nodes
that are infected at <code class="reqn">t_1</code>, the starting time of network simulations. If
the number to be initially infected is passed, this function sets the initial
number infected based on the number specified, either as a set of random
draws from a binomial distribution or as the exact number specified. In
either case, the specific nodes infected are a random sample from the
network. In contrast, a set of specific nodes may be infected by passing a
vector containing the status of each node to <code>netsim</code>.
</p>
<p>For the initially infected nodes, this module sets the time of infection as
<code class="reqn">t_1</code>, the starting time of network simulations. For models with vital
dynamics, the infection time for those initially infected nodes is a random
draw from an exponential distribution with the rate parameter defined by the
<code>di.rate</code> argument. For models without vital dynamics, the infection
time is a random draw from a uniform distribution of integers with a minimum
of 1 and a maximum of the number of time steps in the model. In both cases,
to set the infection times to be in the past, these times are multiplied by
-1, and 2 is added to allow for possible infection times up until step 2,
when the disease simulation time loop starts.
