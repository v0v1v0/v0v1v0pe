<h2>Use inner join (unless the other is specified)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The perform_join function uses an inner join unless the user specifies the
join type.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">perform_join(erd_object, tables_to_join, specified_joins = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>erd_object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class "ERD", which encapsulates the data
frames and the relationships between them. This object is generated using
the <code>create_erd</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tables_to_join</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector listing the names of tables to join.
The first table in this list serves as the main table to which subsequent
tables are joined. The tables are joined in the order specified and utilize
the relationships defined with the first table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>specified_joins</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional named list where each element's name
corresponds to a table in <code>tables_to_join</code> and the value specifies the
type of join to perform with that table. The default value is <code>NULL</code>,
which activates automated mode (which uses inner joins).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This orchestrates the joining of multiple tables based on a specified
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) object. This function extracts the
relationships and join criteria defined within the ERD object and executes
the appropriate join operations using R's <code>dplyr</code> package.
</p>
<p>The function can operate in two modes: automated and user-specified joins. In
automated mode, join types are determined by the relationship symbols in the
ERD object. In user-specified mode, the types of joins are explicitly
provided by the user.
</p>
<p>Implementation Details:
</p>
<p>- Join Variables: For each pair of tables to be joined, the function extracts
the relevant join variables from the ERD object.
</p>
<p>- Join Type: Depending on the relationship symbol associated with each pair
of tables, the function decides whether to perform an inner join or a left
join. This decision is implemented by dynamically invoking the corresponding
dplyr function (<code>inner_join</code> or
<code>left_join</code>).
</p>
<p>- Aggregation: The function uses <code>do.call</code> to dynamically execute
the appropriate join operation, accumulating the result in the
<code>main_table</code> variable, which is ultimately returned.
</p>
<p>Notes:
</p>
<p>-   The function iteratively applies the join operations, using the first
table in <code>tables_to_join</code> as the main table.
</p>
<p>-   The join operations are performed in the order specified in
<code>tables_to_join</code>.
</p>
<p>-   When <code>specified_joins</code> is <code>NULL</code>, the function operates in
automated mode, determining the type of join based on relationship symbols.
</p>
<p>-   The names in <code>specified_joins</code> should match the table names in
<code>tables_to_join</code> for user-specified mode to function correctly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame resulting from the join operations conducted between the
specified tables, consistent with the relationships indicated in the ERD
object. Additionally, the types of joins used are printed to the console.
