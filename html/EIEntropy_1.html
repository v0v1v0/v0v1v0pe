<h2>Ecologic Inference applying entropy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function ei_gce defines the Kullback-Leibler function which
minimises the distance between the distribution of probabilities P and the
distribution Q. The distribution Q is based on prior information that we have
of our variable of interest previous to the analysis. The function will set
the optimization parameters and, using the "optim" function, an optimal
solution is obtained. The function defines the independent variables in the two databases
needed, which we call datahp with "n_hp" observations and datahs with "n_hs"
observations; and the function of the binary variable of interest y. Then the
weights of each observation for the two databases used are defined, if there
are not weights available it will be 1 by default. The errors are calculated
pondering the support vector of dimension <code>var, 0, -var</code>. This support vector
can be specified by the user. The default support vector is based on variance.
We recommend a wider interval with v(-1,0,1) as the maximum.
The restrictions are defined in order to guarantee consistency. The
minimization of Kullback_Leibler distance is solved with "optim" function with
the method "BFGS", with maximum number of iterations 100 and with tolerance
defined by the user. If the user did not define tolerance it will be 1e-24 by
default. For additional details about the methodology see Fernández-Vazquez, et al. (2020)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fn</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the formula that represents the dependent variable in the
optimization.
In the context of this function, 'fn' is used to define the dependent variable
to be optimized by the entropy function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>datahp</code></td>
<td>
<p>The data where the variable of interest y is available and also the independent variables.
Note: The variables and weights used as independent variables must have the same name in 'datahp' and in 'datahs'</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>datahs</code></td>
<td>
<p>The data with the information of the independent variables as a
disaggregated level.
Note: The variables and weights used as independent variables must have the same name in 'datahp' and in 'datahs'. The variables in both databases need to match up in content.</p>

<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method used in the function optim. It can be selected by
the user between: "Nelder-Mead", "BFGS", "CG", "L-BFGS-B", "SANN",

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To solve the optimization upper and lower bounds for p and w are settled, specifically, p and w must be above 0 and lower than 1.
In addition, the initial values of p are settled as the defined prior and the errors (w) as 1/3.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function will provide you a dataframe called table with the next information:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>probabilities</strong>  Probabilities for each individual to each possibility <code>j</code> of the variable of interest <code>y</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>error dual</strong>  Errors calculated to the <code>j</code> possibilities of <code>y</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>predictions</strong>  The prediction for each individual is calculated as the sum of the probability plus the error.
The function provides information about the optimization process as:
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>value_of_entropy</strong>The value of entropy resulting from the optimization.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>iterations</strong> Indicates the times the objective function and the gradient has been evaluated during the optimization process,if any.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>message</strong> Indicates the message if it has been generated in the process of optimization.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>tol</strong> Indicates the tolerance of the optimization process.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>method</strong> Indicates the method used in the optimization
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>v</strong> Indicates the support vector used in the function.
The function provides a dataframe containing the information about lambda:
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p><strong>lambda</strong> The estimated lambda values.
It is provided an object with the restrictions checked which should be approximately zero.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p><strong>check restrictions</strong> Being  <code>g1</code>  the restriction related to the unit probability constraint, <code>g2</code>  to the error unit sum constraint, and <code>g3</code>  to the consistency restriction that implies that the difference between the cross moment in both datasets must be zero.
The restriction g3 can be checked thoroughly with the objects by separate.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p><strong>cross moments hp</strong> Cross moments in <code>datahp</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p><strong>cross moments hs</strong> Cross moments in <code>datahs</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#In this example we use the data of this package
datahp &lt;- financial()
datahs &lt;- social()
# Setting up our function for the dependent variable.
fn               &lt;- datahp$poor_liq ~ Dcollege+Totalincome+Dunemp
#In this case we know that the mean probability of being poor is 0.35.With this function
#we can add the information as information a priori. This information a priori correspond to the
#Q distribution and in this function is called q for the sake of simplicity:
q&lt;- c(0.5,0.5)
v&lt;- matrix(c(-0.2,0,0.2))
#Applying the function ei_gce to our databases. In this case datahp is the
# data where we have our variable of interest
#datahs is the data where we have the information for the disaggregation.
#w can be included if we have weights in both surveys
#Tolerance in this example is fixed in 1e-20
