<h2>Laryngeal and lung cancer cases in Lancashire 1974 - 1983</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Between 1972 and 1980 an industrial waste incinerator operated at a site about 2 kilometres southwest of the town of Coppull in Lancashire, England. Addressing community concerns that there were greater than expected numbers of laryngeal cancer cases in close proximity to the incinerator Diggle et al. (1990) conducted a study investigating risks for laryngeal cancer, using recorded cases of lung cancer as controls. The study area is 20 km x 20 km in size and includes location of residence of patients diagnosed with each cancer type from 1974 to 1983. The site of the incinerator was at easting 354500 and northing 413600.
