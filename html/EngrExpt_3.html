<h2>
Adhesive qualities of a lens coating
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are from two experiments to examine the effect of
formulation changes on the adhesive properties of a eye glass
lens coating.  If the coating would not adhere to the lens
surface then the formulation would not be marketable.  The first
experiment (<code>adhesion</code>) considered only pH (i.e., one
factor).  In this experiemnt three formulations were made (one
at each of three pH levles) and ten samples from each
formulation were tested.  The test procedure for measuring
adhesion is known to contain a large amount of test error.  In
the second experiment ( <code>adhesion2</code> the effect of pH (3
levels) and a catalyst (2 levels) were tested.  The data
consists of five samples were taken from and tested from each of
the six formulations.

following 2 variables.
