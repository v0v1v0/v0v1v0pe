<h2>Synthetic expression data for 12 genes.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the names and expression values for 12 synthetically
generated samples. This example data has time points from 2 to 48 hours with
2 hour resolution and 3 replicates. Random missing data is also included.
Synthetic data was created by randomly selecting parameters for the
extended harmonic oscillator equation (see journal paper link in vignette
for the equation), then adding random uniform noise to each expression.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 12 rows and 73 variables (column 1: sample labels, columns to 2 to 73: numerical values for gene expression in the forsmat CTX.Y (time point X, replicate Y)).</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note the data format: its first column first column has gene labels/names, and
all other columns have expression data. This expression data is ordered by
time point then by replicate, and has evenly spaced time points. Any missing
data has cells left blank.
