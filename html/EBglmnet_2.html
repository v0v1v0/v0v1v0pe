<h2>An Example Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a 1000x481 sample feature matrix</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(BASIS)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is:
int [1:1000, 1:481] 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ...
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data was simulated on a 2400 centimorgan (cM) chromosome of an F2 population from 
a cross of two inbred lines. The three genotype of AA, Aa and aa were coded as
1, 0, -1, respectively. Each column corresponds to an even spaced d= 5cM genetic marker, 
and each row represents a sample. The Haldane map function was assumed in the simulation,
such that correlation between markers having distance d is <code class="reqn">R = exp(-2d)</code>. Example of using this dataset for multiple QTL mapping is available in the EBglmnet Vignette.</p>
