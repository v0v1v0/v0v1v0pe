<h2>Predict the concentration of samples based on fitting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Based on the 5pl or 4pl regression, predict the concentration of 
of unknown samples. Assume the regression has been accomplished.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">predictAll(batches)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>batches</code></td>
<td>
<p>list of elisa_batch objects containing 
both the raw data and the fitted regression model.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The input data structure contains both the data (ODs) and
the fitted regression model. The estimation of unknonw concentration
based on the ODs and the standard curve of each plate.  
The batch effects are corrected/normalized and the corrected
concentrations also are	also written into the batch data
structure, if there are more than one batches in the data.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The same list of elisa_batch with estimated
sample concentrations based on ODs and the fitted regression
model. The estimated concentrations normalized/corrected
between different batches are also calculated and recorded.
