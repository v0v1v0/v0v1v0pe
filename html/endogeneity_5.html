<h2>Recursive two-stage models to address endogeneity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package supports various recursive two-stage models to address the endogeneity issue. The details of the implemented models are discussed in Peng (2022). In a recursive two-stage model, the dependent variable of the first stage is also the endogenous variable of interest in the second stage. The endogeneity is captured by the correlation in the error terms of the two stages. <br><br>
Recursive two-stage models can be used to address the endogeneity of treatment variables in observational study and the endogeneity of mediators in experiments. <br><br>
The first-stage supports linear model, probit model, and Poisson lognormal model. The second-stage supports linear and probit models. These models can be used to address the endogeneity of continuous, binary, and count variables. When the endogenous variable is binary, it can be unobserved or partially unobserved, but the identification can be weak. <br><br></p>
