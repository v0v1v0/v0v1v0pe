<h2>GoF tests based on the likelihood for the Weibull distribution</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the Weibull GoF tests based on the three following statistics: the score, Wald and likelihood ratio GoF tests. These tests include the Weibull distribution in larger statistics and apply a parametric test to the additional parameter.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">WLK.test(x, type = "GG1", funEstimate = "MLE", procedure = "S", nsim = 200, r=0)</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The tests are based on different generalized Weibull families: the tests (GG1) and (GG2) are based on the Generalized Gamma distribution, the tests (EW) are based on the Exponentiated Weibull, (PGW) on the Power Generalized Weibull, (MO) on the Marshall-Olkin distribution and (MW) are based on the Modified Weibull distribution. Each family can have nine versions depending on the procedure used (score, Wald or likelihood ratio statistic) and on the parameters estimation methods: maximum likelihood, moment or least squares method, except GG1 which has only three versions using the maximum likelihood estimators. 
</p>
<p>The tests statistics <code class="reqn">T1</code> and <code class="reqn">T2</code> are a combination between two Wald test statistics: PGW with ME (<code class="reqn">\breve{PGW}_w</code>) and MW with MLE (<code class="reqn">\hat{MW}_w</code>) after they are centered with their mean values (<code class="reqn">\overline{\breve{PGW}}_w</code> and <code class="reqn">\overline{\hat{MW}}_w</code>) and normalized by their standard deviations (respectively <code class="reqn">sd(\breve{PGW}_w)</code> and <code class="reqn">sd(\hat{MW}_w)</code>). 
</p>
<p>The expressions of the statistics <code class="reqn">T1</code> and <code class="reqn">T2</code> are as follows:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">T1=max(\left|\frac{\breve{PGW}_w-\overline{\breve{PGW}_w}}{sd(\breve{PGW}_w)}\right|,\left|\frac{\hat{MW}_w-\overline{\hat{MW}_w}}{sd(\hat{MW}_w)}\right|)</code>
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">T2=0.5\left|\frac{\breve{PGW}_w-\overline{\breve{PGW}_w}}{sd(\breve{PGW}_w)}\right|+0.5\left|\frac{\hat{MW}_w-\overline{\hat{MW}_w}}{sd(\hat{MW}_w)}\right|</code>
</p>
<p>All the previous tests can be applied to type II right censored samples (simple censoring). The censoring is introduced in the MLEs. 
A second statistic <code class="reqn">G</code> similar to <code class="reqn">T</code>, is combining Wald and likelihood ratio tests based on the Generalized Gamma distribution:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">G=0.5\left|\frac{\hat{GG}^1_l-\overline{\hat{GG}^1_l}}{sd(\hat{GG}^1_l)}\right|+0.5\left|\frac{\hat{GG}^1_w-\overline{\hat{GG}^1_w}}{sd(\hat{GG}^1_w)}\right|</code>
</p>
