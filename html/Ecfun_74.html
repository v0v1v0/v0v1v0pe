<h2>
Functions deleted from the Ecfun package
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Several functions were deleted from <code>Ecfun</code> 
0.2-5, because they no longer worked, and 
it was not clear if there was demand for 
them.  
</p>
<p>If you need them, you can get the 
documentation and code for them from CRAN 
&gt; Packages &gt; Archive (near the bottom 
center) &gt; <code>Ecfun</code> &gt; 
<code>Ecfun_0.2-0.tar.gz</code>.  
I don't expect the code to work.  
However, I might be willing to 
collaborate in restoring the 
functionality to <code>Ecfun</code>.  
</p>
<p><code>readFinancialCrisisFiles</code>
was a companion to a book.  This 
function required the <code>gdata</code>
package, which was scheduled to be 
removed from CRAN.  
</p>
<p><code>USsenateClass</code> called by default 
<code>readUSsenate</code>.  <code>UShouse.senate</code> 
and <code>mergeUShouse.senate</code> called by 
default both <code>readUSsenate</code> and 
<code>readUShouse</code>.  The latter two and the 
remaining functions deleted did web scraping, 
and the web sites from which they scraped 
information changed, and it did not seem worth 
the work required to continue to maintain them.
