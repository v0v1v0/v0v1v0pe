<h2>Parallelization in ecr</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In ecr it is possible to parallelize the fitness function evaluation
to make use, e.g., of multiple CP cores or nodes in a HPC cluster.
For maximal flexibility this is realized by means of the <span class="pkg">parallelMap</span> package
(see the <a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/parallelMap">official
GitHub page</a> for instructions on how to set up parallelization).
The different levels of parallelization can be specified in the
<code>parallelStart*</code> function. At them moment only the level
“ecr.evaluateFitness” is supported.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that parallelization comes along with some overhead. Thus activating
parallelization, e.g., for evaluation a fitness function which is evaluated
lightning-fast, may result in higher computation time. However, if the function
evaluations are computationally more expensive, parallelization leads to
significant running time benefits.
