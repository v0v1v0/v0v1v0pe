<h2>Generate special functions using orthonormal functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>orthopolynom can be used to generate special functions,
but for expansion they should be modified.  As of this
writing, orthopolynom generates polynomials for
Chebyshev, Hermite, Legendre and many other functions,
their integrals and derivatives, and more.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">polywrapper(basePoly = orthopolynom::chebyshev.t.polynomials, kMax = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>basePoly</code></td>
<td>
<p>A polynomial list from orthopoly</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kMax</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer.  The maximum order of the function
generated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function polywrapper does 2 things:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Generate functions from polynomial coefficients.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses x as the 1st argument, and the order as
the second; this means the generated functions can be
used in eOuter and eMatrixOuter.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The functions so generated can be used as simple special functions,
as well as being useful in feature building.
</p>
<p>Since the coefficients from orthopolynom are generated
by recursion, an upper limit of the function order
needs to be set when calling polywrapper.  This is the
main limitation of polywrapper.  Fortunately, since
the functions are compactly stored, kMax can be set
quite high if desired.  Note that usually the kMax
is known, and is relatively small.
</p>
<p>NB: The input x may need to be normalized.  orthopolynom
has the function scaleX for just such a purpose.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function which is compatible with eOuter and eMatrixOuter
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Generate a Chebyshev function of the form
# chebyFUN(x,k), where x is the input and k is the order.
# In this case, k must be no more than 5 (since that
# is the value passed to kMax), although it is
# easy to set this to a higher order if desired.
chebyFUN &lt;- polywrapper(basePoly=orthopolynom::chebyshev.t.polynomials,
  kMax=5)
# Now the function chebyFUN
# can be used as any other function:
x &lt;- seq(-1,+1,0.01)
plot(x,chebyFUN(x,5),type="l")
eOuter(seq(-1,+1,0.01),0:3,chebyFUN)
</code></pre>
